They are helping us make coding education more accessible to people around the world.</p><p>And now I'm thrilled to announce that we're using Replit's tools to create two new programming courses. The first course will be an interactive introduction to coding in Rust. It will feature:</p><ol><li>An interactive course component where you code in Rust and figure out how to get automated tests to pass.</li><li>Conceptual slides that explain how Rust works, with syntax examples. You can access these at any time while you're coding your way through the course.</li><li>And also an end-to-end video walkthrough of the Rust course.</li></ol><p>We are planning to push this course live by late October.</p><p>We are also building a new Python course that will make use of the new Repl.web framework.</p><p>Replit is making these courses possible through a $100,000 grant they've created for our nonprofit. Half of these resources will go toward the development of these new courses. The other half will go toward our ongoing development of <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-data-science-curriculum-with-advanced-math-and-machine-learning/\">the upcoming Data Science curriculum</a>.</p><p>For now, I encourage you to check out another course we've made with the help of grants from Replit, focused on their Kaboom.js game development framework. If you want to do some gamedev right in your browser, this is a great place to start:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-mario-zelda-and-space-invaders-with-kaboom-js/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">How to Build Super Mario Bros, Zelda, and Space Invaders with Kaboom.js</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">In this video course I show you how to build three popular games using thelatest game development library for JavaScript called Kaboom.js.

    "html": "<p>Did you know there's a super sketchy underworld of websites that sell your personal data to whatever creepy rando will pay for it?</p><p>Even if you're not on social media, random stalker types can access all kinds of facts about you including:</p><ul><li>Your age</li><li>Your relationship status and marriage history</li><li>Email addresses and phone numbers you've used</li><li>Places you've lived and your current address</li><li>Any court records you have (including tickets and arrests)</li><li>And even information about your kids. Your kids!</li></ul><p>It's all super creepy, and in any sane world this would be illegal. But it appears to be at least semi-legal. This is a multi-billion dollar industry we're talking about.</p><p>You may have heard of Equifax, Experian, Transunion and other \"data brokers\". These are pretty entrenched and even work with the US government.</p><p>But there's an entire category of data brokers you may not have heard of, who roll up all your private data into modern SaaS platforms, then sell it to anyone willing to plunk down a monthly fee.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-remove-your-data-from-these-people-finder-type-websites\">How to Remove your Data from these People Finder-type Websites</h2><p>The good news is you can opt-out of many of these websites with a single email confirmation process.</p><p>In this article, I'll walk you through how to opt-out of some of the biggest ones in a single sitting. Specifically:</p><ul><li>Spokeo</li><li>People Finder</li><li>People Finders</li><li>PrivateEye.com</li><li>MyLife.com</li><li>Intelius</li><li>PeekYou</li><li>BeenVerified</li><li>And the grandaddy of them all: WhitePages.com</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that there are dozens of these websites, and new ones crop up every year. The only long-term answer to this will be to pressure the US government to better-regulate this industry, or to outlaw it altogether.</p><p>With all these sites out there, it's easy to feel hopeless. But every site you opt-out of slightly reduces the likelihood someone will try to stalk you or steal your identity.</p><p>This is very much worth your time and effort to fight. So let's get started.</p><h2 id=\"the-first-rule-of-fighting-data-brokers-don-t-give-them-any-more-of-your-data\">The First Rule of Fighting Data Brokers: Don't Give Them Any More of Your Data</h2><p>Before you start your opt-out spree, you should take a few precautions so you don't end up giving these evil corps even more of your information in the process:</p><ol><li>I recommend using a VPN if you have one. <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-in-5-minutes-for-free-and-why-you-urgently-need-one-d5cdba361907/\">A VPN can mask your IP address and location</a>. And if you really want security, you can even <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-server-at-home/\">set up your own VPN server</a>.</li><li>Incognito mode can prevent these sites from accessing your cookies, local storage, autocomplete data, and other data you may have saved in your browser. If you're in Chrome, you can open an incognito window by clicking in the menu bar \"File\", then \"New Incognito Window\".</li><li>Finally, I recommend using a temporary email service like <a href=\"https://10minutemail.com/\">10minutemail.com</a> for email confirmations. This way you don't give these data brokers your current email address. Afterward, you can forward confirmation to your own personal email for your records.</li></ol><p>Also note that this article will focus on the \"low-hanging fruit\" data brokers where a simple email confirmation is enough to remove your data.</p><p>There are plenty of other data brokers who require you to jump through hoops like calling them, sending them physical letters, faxing them (yes – faxing them), or even sending them a copy of your ID to confirm your identity. If you can make time to do this, I applaud you. This article will still help if you don't have time for that, though.</p><p>Again, I won't cover these sorts of hard-to-reach data brokers, and will instead focus on the low-hanging fruit.</p><p>By the end of your session, you should have an inbox full of opt-out confirmations, like this.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/09/10_Minute_Mail_-_Free_Anonymous_Temporary_email_-_10_Minute_Mail_-_Free_Anonymous_Temporary_email.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Taking back your privacy one opt-out at a time</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"how-to-opt-out-of-spokeo-search\">How to Opt out of Spokeo Search</h3><p>Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://spokeo.com\">Spokeo.com</a> and find yourself there.</p><p>Step 2: Copy the URL from the address bar. You'll need this to opt-out.</p><p>Step 3: Go to <a href=\"https://www.spokeo.com/optout\">https://www.spokeo.com/optout</a></p><p>Step 4: Paste in the URL of your Spokeo profile and enter your email address. Get ready to identify some busses and traffic lights in the captcha. (Yeah, you're going to be doing this a lot today.)</p><p>Step 5: Check your email for the verification email and follow its instructions.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-remove-your-info-from-mylife-com-search\">How to Remove Your Info from MyLife.com Search</h3><p>There isn't a way to opt-out of MyLife directly on the web, so you will need to send them an email. If you do this, you'll need to include some data in your email, but you can just include data that's already listed on their site.</p><p>Step 1: Find your record on MyLife.com</p><p>Step 2: You will need to send them an email at privacy@mylife.com, with the subject line \"opt-out\". Here is a template for you to use in your email:</p><pre><code>My name is [NAME]. Remove my records from mylife.com and all of your other databases.\n\nTo confirm my identity: \n\nMy date of birth is [DATE OF BIRTH]\n\nMy current address is [ADDRESS]\n\nMy past address is [ADDRESS]\n\nHere is a link to my record on mylife.com: [LINK]\n\nPlease email me back to confirm that my data has been deleted.\n\nThank you.</code></pre><h3 id=\"how-to-opt-out-of-people-finder-search\">How to Opt Out of People Finder Search</h3><p>Unfortunately, People Finder's opt-out is broken.

I found tons of sites linking to this. They seem to have just pulled the page down.</figcaption></figure><p>But good news – I did some more research, and I believe you can still opt out of PeopleFinder by opting out through its parent company, Intelius. Doing this should also opt you out of several other small data broker websites that Intelius owns.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-opt-out-of-intelius-search-and-remove-your-data-from-lots-of-whitepages-type-sites\">How to Opt Out of Intelius Search and Remove your Data from Lots of WhitePages-type Sites</h3><p>This should opt you out of PeopleFinder, as well as several other data broker sites.</p><p>Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://www.intelius.com/opt-out/submit/\">https://www.intelius.com/opt-out/submit/</a></p><p>Step 2: Search for yourself.

It looks like every once in a while, PrivateEye moves their opt out process. If anyone can find their current one, message me on Twitter and I'll add it here. Here are some of their now-defunct opt-out URLs:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://secure.privateeye.com/help/default.aspx#26\">http://secure.privateeye.com/help/default.aspx#26</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.privateeye.com/static/process_optout\">https://www.privateeye.com/static/process_optout</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.privateeye.com/opt-out/submit/\">https://www.privateeye.com/opt-out/submit/</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"instant-checkmate-never-actually-sends-you-the-opt-out-confirmation-email\">Instant Checkmate Never Actually Sends You The Opt-Out Confirmation Email</h3><p>You can fill out the form at <a href=\"https://www.instantcheckmate.com/opt-out/submit/\">https://www.instantcheckmate.com/opt-out/submit/</a> but they won't actually send you the confirmation email. I've tried several times from different locations, browsers, turned off ad blockers, and everything.</p><p>Also, I turned off my ad blocker and checked to see whether there was just some JavaScript error that was preventing the form from submitting. It looks like Instant Checkmate immediately tries to grab any data in your browser's Local Storage, Session Storage, and even sees if they can get any Facebook data your browser has.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/09/https___www_instantcheckmate_com_opt-out_submit_.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Instant Checkmate. It would be tough to come up with a more menacing name for a data broker.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"keep-fighting-the-good-fight\">Keep Fighting the Good Fight</h2><p>These sites are like kudzu. You've got to keep hacking away at them with your digital machete.</p><p><strong>I will keep this list updated.</strong></p><p>I recommend you bookmark this list and come back to it from time to time to double check and make sure these data broker sites haven't re-listed you. Or that new sites haven't cropped up to sell your data.</p><p>I also recommend you link to this list from your own personal website if you can, and help spread the word.</p><p>If you find any other data broker websites that people can easily opt-out of, please <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1186124777246904325\">send me a DM on Twitter</a>.</p><p>Stay safe out there.</p><p>– Quincy</p>",

But we have strategies for breaking this corpus of knowledge down into manageable components.</p><p>The most important design decision is this: <strong>optimizing for developers</strong>. Instead of designing the curriculum with schools in mind, we are focusing on individual, motivated adult learners who already have a baseline understanding of web development. (If they don't yet, they can just complete the first half of freeCodeCamp's curriculum. It is the sole prerequisite for this Data Science coursework.)</p><p>Since we can assume that learners already know how to code, we can teach mathematics in an entirely new way. Instead of using traditional lectures or homework exercises – tools like pencils, paper, and graphing calculators – we can incorporate Python.</p><p>This practical spin gives a new sense of relevance to age-old tasks of solving equations and proving theorems.</p><h2 id=\"what-if-i-already-know-some-of-these-topics-can-i-still-earn-the-certifications\">What if I Already Know Some of These Topics? Can I Still Earn the Certifications? </h2><p>As with freeCodeCamp's web development curriculum, most of the coursework is entirely optional.</p><p>If you've already learned some of these topics in the past, you can jump ahead and build the certification projects. Once you prove your knowledge, you can claim the certification.</p><p>The freeCodeCamp curriculum will remain a straight line with no electives. But you can pick where you want to start on that line, and you can always back-track if you need to review.</p><h2 id=\"doesn-t-freecodecamp-already-cover-all-of-these-topics-on-the-community-youtube-channel\">Doesn't freeCodeCamp Already Cover All of These Topics on the Community YouTube Channel?</h2><p>Yes. We have free full-length courses on almost all of these topics on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp\">our community YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>Videos are much easier to produce than integrated, interactive curricula. They are just the first step toward our goal of fully teaching and certifying data scientists.</p><p>These videos will remain a solid supplementary learning resource. They are great for learning on the go, and they delve further into some concepts that our more practical curriculum will only touch on.</p><h2 id=\"what-if-i-am-midway-through-the-current-freecodecamp-curriculum\">What if I am Midway Through the Current freeCodeCamp Curriculum?</h2><p>No problem. You won't lose any of your progress.</p><p>We will turn some of our certifications into legacy certifications (like the current Data Visualization certification) into a legacy certification. But you will still own it, and you will still be able to claim it even after we release the new certifications.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-release-roadmap\">What is the Release Roadmap?</h2><p>Note that the freeCodeCamp community does not set public launch dates. Instead, we roll new coursework out as it's ready, then continually maintain and refine it.</p><p>Here is what we plan to release:</p><p><strong>Stage #1</strong>: We will publish the certification projects, which you can complete in order to obtain each of these data science certifications. We will also publish video courses that you can use – in combination with other learning resources – to learn the concepts.</p><p><strong>Stage #2</strong>: We will publish the optional practice projects for each certification. These will replace the videos, which we'll move over to freeCodeCamp's supplemental learning resource section.</p><p>We think we can accomplish most of this in the first 2 years. Then...</p><p><strong>Stage #3</strong>: We will add additional optional practice projects to provide even more practice and repetition. Our eventual goal is to have more programming practice than a single human could reasonably complete in a lifetime. (You could argue that we already have this through our client-side implementation of Project Euler and Rosetta code, but there are still millennia worth of years worth of mathematical knowledge we can eventually cover.) </p><p>Learning is a life-long endeavor. And the freeCodeCamp curriculum will continue to evolve to reflect this.</p><h2 id=\"will-all-of-this-be-open-source\">Will All of This be Open Source?</h2><p>Yes. As with all of freeCodeCamp's other code, it will be licensed using <a href=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/LICENSE.md\">the extremely permissive BSD-3 license</a>. (It's similar to the MIT license but also protects our nonprofit from impersonation.)</p><p>And as with the rest of freeCodeCamp's curriculum, all of our coursework will be Creative Commons-licensed. The <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a> to be exact. This license is permissive and has no commercial restrictions. That's right. You could build a business around freeCodeCamp if you wanted to.</p><h2 id=\"how-can-i-get-involved-in-this-new-data-science-curriculum\">How Can I Get Involved in This New Data Science Curriculum?</h2><p>If you are a teacher, practicing data scientist, or a mathematics enthusiast, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLiGgmYh2DxdTmPxS141J5knuOtcYN9ulOtBwsRbkuVwXRRQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\">we would welcome your feedback</a>.</p><p>And for everyone else, you should support our pledge drive. Help us fund a free, open source data science curriculum for you, your family, and your neighbors around the world. <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\">Donate here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-even-more-about-the-data-science-curriculum-and-certifications\">How can I learn even more about the Data Science Curriculum and certifications?</h2><p>You're in luck. I went on The Changelog podcast (a popular open source podcast) to talk about these new certifications we're building. You can give it a listen in the embedded podcast player below.

This list of directories lives in an environment variable called <code>PATH</code>, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:</blockquote><pre><code>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\n</code></pre><blockquote>Directories in <code>PATH</code> are searched from left to right, so a matching executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory will be searched first, then <code>/usr/bin</code>, then <code>/bin</code>.</blockquote><p>And here is their explanation of what a Shim is. I'm quoting them at length again because I really can't explain this better myself.</p><blockquote>pyenv works by inserting a directory of <em>shims</em> at the front of your <code>PATH</code>:</blockquote><pre><code>$(pyenv root)/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\n</code></pre><blockquote>Through a process called <em>rehashing</em>, pyenv maintains shims in that directory to match every Python command across every installed version of Python—<code>python</code>, <code>pip</code>, and so on.</blockquote><blockquote>Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along to pyenv.</blockquote><p>Here's how to update your <code>.bash_profile</code> in Bash (which is installed in MacOS by default):</p><pre><code>echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile\necho 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</code></pre><p>Or if you've installed ZSH (or OhMyZSH) like I have, you'll want to edit the <code>.zshrc</code> file instead:</p><pre><code>echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc\necho 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc</code></pre><p>Then you want to add PyEnv Init to your terminal.

And the US became the economic force it is today thanks in part to cheap immigrant labor during the industrial revolution.</p><p>But here in the 21st century, we no longer get work done by managing people who tend grain fields, import spices from Asian colonies, or install railroads across the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>Now we get work done by managing machines.</p><h2 id=\"learn-to-code-because-the-nature-of-work-has-fundamentally-changed\">Learn to Code – Because the Nature of Work has Fundamentally Changed</h2><p>Today, it is no longer humans who do most of the work — it’s machines.</p><p>Think about it — every day, humans make 3.5 billion Google searches. It’s machines that carry out that work — not humans.</p><p>Think about how many man-hours it would take for humans to conduct even a single Google search manually. Can you imagine a bunch of PhD’s phoning each other around the clock deliberating about which documents they should recommend to whom? This work is only even remotely practical if it’s done by machines.</p><p>Trip Advisor helps you decide where to go for vacation. Expedia helps you book the right flight to get there. Google Maps directs you to the airport. All of these services are within the reach of average consumers thanks to the hard work of machines.</p><p>But machines are only able to do all this work because humans tell them exactly what to do. And the only way for humans to do this is by writing software.</p><p>That’s right — computers are not nearly as smart as humans. For computers to succeed at the jobs we’ve assigned them, they need us humans to give them extremely clear instructions.</p><p>That means coding.</p><h2 id=\"coding-isn-t-some-niche-skill-it-really-is-the-new-literacy-\">Coding isn’t Some Niche Skill. It really is “the new literacy.”</h2><p>It’s the essential 21st century skill that every ambitious person needs to learn if they want to succeed.</p><p>Don’t believe me? Just look at the legal profession. Software is turning it inside out, and <a href=\"http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/whos_eating_law_firms_lunch\" rel=\"noopener\">causing mass unemployment</a> for the lawyers who can’t code.</p><p>The same is increasingly true for managers, marketers, accountants, doctors, and pretty much every white-collar job in between.</p><p>And that’s to say nothing of the 3 million Americans whose jobs primarily involve driving a car, and billions of people world-wide who do other repetitive tasks that will soon be handled more inexpensively and effectively by machines.</p><p>I’m hopeful that these displaced workers will be able to retrain for new jobs through inexpensive education programs like Starbuck’s partnership with Arizona State University — where all of its employees get a free college education (hopefully picking up relevant new skills like software development) — or government-sponsored equivalents.</p><p>At the very least, they’ll have access to a free math and computer science education through initiatives like EdX, and a free programming education through Free Code Camp.</p><h2 id=\"program-or-be-programmed\">Program or be Programmed</h2><p>We have a concept in software development called “the technology steamroller”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*UArvqBFDkaQGysgMEFhKjw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Stewart Brand, founder of the Whole Earth Catalog and the Long Now Foundation</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“Once a new technology rolls over you, if you’re not part of the steamroller, you’re part of the road.” — Stewart Brand</blockquote><p>You can’t stop technology. You can only adapt to it.</p><p>Once a history-shaping new technology comes out of the genie bottle, you can’t put it back. This was true for airplanes, antibiotics, and nuclear warheads. And it’s true for microprocessors, the internet, and machine learning.</p><p>Those who adapt to these permanent waves of changes flourish. Those who shrug them off — or fail to even realize they exist — asymptotically approach irrelevance.</p><p>Coding is the new literacy. Like reading was in the 12th century, writing was in the 16th century, arithmetic was in the 18th century, and driving a car was in the 20th century.</p><p>And just like how not everyone who learns to write will go on to become a professional writer — nor everyone who learns arithmetic will go on to become a professional mathematician — not everyone who learns to code will go on to become a software developer. But all people who learn these things will be immensely better off as a result of their efforts.</p><p>Think of your ability to read the labels on your prescription drugs, or your ability to count the money that a banker hands you when you make a withdrawal. There’s something equally important that you can do if you can code: take tedious parts of your daily life and automate them.</p><p>And some people take this basic skill much further, as a way to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/a-google-programmer-blew-off-a-500000-salary-at-startup--because-hes-already-making-3-million-every-year-2014-1\" rel=\"noopener\">amass great personal wealth</a>, or to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7UHzdvkd-Q&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnQ048Pa8sAqJoVRhx8TJtM\" rel=\"noopener\">make the world a better place</a>.</p><h2 id=\"ships-are-meant-for-sailing\">Ships are meant for sailing</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*k0fUEL6Kuy9GMOgmWsKoBw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Rear Admiral Grace Hopper invented the first compiler and pioneered high-level programming languages.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>A ship in port is safe, but that is not what ships are for. Sail out to sea and do new things. — Grace Hopper</blockquote><p>Computers, at their core, are number crunching machines.</p><p>Human brains, at their core, are learning machines.</p><p>It may seem like you’ll never be able to code. It may seem like you’re just not wired for it.</p><p>And there will probably be a parade of people behind you who’ve tried to learn to code, given up, and are eager to commiserate with you.</p><p>And these people will read articles like the Tech Crunch article, and share them on Facebook — like 14,000 people did yesterday — further discouraging the millions of people around the world who are working hard to achieve this new literacy.</p><p>But coding detractors are probably incorrect about their inability to learn coding. There’s a growing sentiment among educators and cognitive scientists that any able-minded person can learn to code — just like you can learn to read, write, do arithmetic, or drive a car.</p><p>Sure, people with dyslexia have a harder time reading, people with dyscalculia have a harder time doing math, and both have a harder time programming. But even these are limitations that can be overcome, and <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Can-anyone-learn-how-to-code/answer/Quincy-Larson\" rel=\"noopener\">programmers overcome limitations every day</a>.</p><p>So heed Grace Hopper’s advice. Sail out to sea and learn new things. Put that learning machine in your head to use.</p><p>Learn to code. Learn to talk to machines. And flourish.</p>",

They can expose you to a broad array of tools and concepts.</p><p>Since I started learning to code back in 2012, I have listened to thousands of hours of technology podcasts – usually while exercising or commuting. Many of these podcasts are still going strong. And this article will focus on these time-tested learning resources.</p><p>A note before we get started: before you start tweeting at me about how I left off your favorite podcast, note that I intentionally excluded most business- and news-focused podcasts. Instead, I've zeroed in on podcasts that are run by developers, and with developers in mind as the core audience.</p><p>I can say with confidence that all of these podcasts are solid. If you are a developer, or are interested in becoming a developer, these podcasts will entertain you and enlighten your commutes.

Well, call me old fashioned, but I just use the default podcast app on my iPhone. It's free, there are no ads, and I'm not sharing my data with a third party.</p><p>I listen to everything on double speed. And I make aggressive use of the \"skip 15 seconds ahead\" button.</p><p>One area where Apple's podcast app falls short is its search engine. So for search, I use an awesome podcast search engine tool created by freeCodeCamp contributor Wenbin Fang called <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/\">ListenNotes.com</a>. It's lightning fast and has tons of helpful features, including a convenient HTML5-based podcast player.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/01/The_freeCodeCamp_Podcast_-_freeCodeCamp___Listen_Notes.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/The_freeCodeCamp_Podcast_-_freeCodeCamp___Listen_Notes.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/The_freeCodeCamp_Podcast_-_freeCodeCamp___Listen_Notes.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/The_freeCodeCamp_Podcast_-_freeCodeCamp___Listen_Notes.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/The_freeCodeCamp_Podcast_-_freeCodeCamp___Listen_Notes.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>I love ListenNotes so much that I would have happily linked just to ListenNotes for this article. That's how good its user experience is.</p><p>But I didn't want to deprive these awesome podcast creators of the visitors and <code>rel=\"doFollow\"</code> backlinks. These podcast creators deserve all the attention their websites can get.</p><p>One other cool fact: Wenbin is a podcast fanatic, and he has come up with some novel ways of queuing up podcasts and listening to them on the go. If you want to become a podcast superuser like him, you can <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/podcasts-are-my-new-wikipedia-the-perfect-informal-learning-resource/#how-exactly-do-i-listen-to-podcasts-and-use-them-as-my-new-wikipedia\">try his method too</a>.</p><p>That's all for me. I hope you learn a lot from these podcasts, and leverage these free learning resources to become a better developer. Happy coding.</p>",

    "html": "<p>2020 was a long, challenging year. But one bright spot is the thousands of people who contributed to freeCodeCamp this year. They're helping our nonprofit accomplish its mission to create free learning resources for everyone.</p><p>And in this article, I'm going to publicly thank the 148 kind people who, in my humble opinion, contributed the most to our global developer community in 2020.</p><p>In 2020, people used freeCodeCamp for a grand total of <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-2020/\">more than 1.3 billion minutes</a>. That's 2,500 years, or an average of 2,500 people using freeCodeCamp at any given moment.</p><p>freeCodeCamp is a tiny donor supported nonprofit with a budget of only $498,521.</p><p>And yet we are able to accomplish the mission of a 100-person nonprofit with a multi-million dollar budget.</p><p>How are we able to do this?</p><p>Because we have a global community of volunteer contributors.</p><p>I have met with all of these people over the years, and I can say without hesitation: these contributors are among the most kind, thoughtful people I've ever met.</p><p>And on the final day of 2020, I want to recognize their incredible efforts and all that they've accomplished this year.</p><p>Without further ado, here are 2020's top contributors who make possible freeCodeCamp's ambitious mission of helping people around the world learn to code for free.</p><p>I've broken this list down into 4 broad categories:</p><ol><li><strong>Forum contributors</strong>. These are people who helped answer questions on the freeCodeCamp forum. They also gave people feedback on their coding projects, and helped keep the forum a friendly, inclusive place.</li><li><strong>Code contributors</strong>. freeCodeCamp (and its sister project, <a href=\"https://www.devdocs.io\">DevDocs.io</a>) are open source. In 2020, we merged 1,397 commits from contributors around the world into <a href=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp\">freeCodeCamp's main repository</a>. Contributors have also helped translate freeCodeCamp's curriculum into both Spanish and Chinese, and we will launch those translations soon.</li><li><strong>Publication contributors</strong>. The freeCodeCamp community runs an academic journal of sorts. And to date, we've edited and published more than 7,000 tutorials on math, computer science, programming, and career advice.</li><li><strong>YouTube course contributors</strong>. The freeCodeCamp community also runs a YouTube channel with full-length courses on a wide variety of software engineering tools and concepts. We published more than 120 full-length courses in 2020 from dozens of contributors.</li></ol><p>Many of these contributors are familiar faces. They have been contributing to our community's mission for years. And there are also plenty of new people who just recently discovered the community.</p><h2 id=\"how-we-re-celebrating-these-top-contributors\">How We're Celebrating These Top Contributors</h2><p>Once it is safe to do so, we are going to throw some big, in-person top contributor parties in major cities around the world.</p><p>Last time we did this, we had parties in New York City, Dublin, and Hong Kong. And this time, we'll try to do it in even more cities so more top contributors can participate.</p><p>We're also recognizing these contributors by adding a special top contributor badge to their freeCodeCamp public profiles.</p><p>This list is in alphabetical order, by category of contribution. Note that many of these people contributed in several ways to the community. But for simplicity, I chose a single category to represents their contributions.</p><p>Also note that a few of our contributors prefer to remain pseudo-anonymous, so you may see some silly names in here as well.</p><h2 id=\"freecodecamp-forum-top-contributors\">freeCodeCamp Forum Top Contributors</h2><p>(Links point to the contributor's freeCodeCamp forum account.)</p><ul><li><a

And we're running an entire global nonprofit with that.</p><p>(By the way, thanks to the 6,560 kind people who support freeCodeCamp with monthly donation of $5. If you aren't donating yet, you can <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\">join these awesome supporters here</a>.)</p><p>2020 was a long, long year for a number of reasons.

Not at all. The reality is our nonprofit has been careful about how we allocate our scarce donor funds.

This is, essentially, an annual report that nonprofits file with the US government.</p><p>We have a 10 year project road map in thanks to our careful planning. We don't have any investors or corporate interests to answer to. We answer only to you – our community. </p><p>And I hope we are doing a good job of giving you what you all want: excellent free learning resources on math, computer science, and programming. Because we are going to be doing more of that. With your help (and your donations) we can do a lot more.</p><p>Remember those numbers from earlier?

It was one of the most active study groups in Canada, drawing crowds of developers each week.</p><p>But Alex wasn’t writing me about the Toronto study group. He was writing me because he wanted to tell me about an endurance challenge he’d dreamed up.</p><p>The challenge was this: Alex wanted to code for at least an hour every day — for the next 100 days in a row.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*gxqZjvLgyl_AQNSD17Eu2Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Comic by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DoodleTimeSarah/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Sarah Andersen</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Alex had written an article explaining the rules of his challenge, and publicly committing to the challenge. He hoped that a few other people would read his article and join him on his challenge.</p><p>And he came up with a Twitter hashtag to go with it: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23100daysofcode&amp;src=typd\" rel=\"noopener\">#100DaysOfCode</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5UFxgU9XPZOUtvudcc0hXQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>“Oh! Hi!” One of the freeCodeCamp events in Toronto, the city where the #100DaysOfCode Challenge was born. Photo by Justin Richardson.</figcaption></figure><p>Little did I know that 18 months later, <strong>thousands of people would be tweeting this hashtag hundreds of times each day.</strong></p><p>Today, people who have committed to the #100DaysOfCode challenge use the hashtag to share their progress, projects, and milestones they’ve hit — like landing their first developer job.</p><p>So how did Alex transform from a lone developer who wanted to improve his coding skills into the leader of a global movement involving thousands of developers?</p><h3 id=\"and-who-the-heck-is-alexander-kallaway-anyway\">And who the heck is Alexander Kallaway, anyway?</h3><p>A few years ago, Alex was just another high school student in Russia. He was passionate about foreign languages, and learning both English and Japanese. His passion eventually took him to Japan, where he continued his studies at a Japanese university.</p><p>One day while in Japan, Alex spotted an English-language copy of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PKG4DM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000PKG4DM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=out0b4b-20&amp;linkId=eba22c67cdb42c3e7b22eb7dd4bcb098\" rel=\"noopener\">The 4 Hour Workweek</a> on a bookshelf. He says this book opened his eyes to entrepreneurship, and the notion that anyone could start a project that makes a big impact — not just traditional “business people.”</p><p>He figured out a way to move to Canada so he could attend business school.</p><p>And it was there that his future wife, Anna, reached out to him, wanting to learn more about studying abroad and how he’d managed to do it. She now lives in Toronto with Alex.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*mKM0qA9LbPD8Ln-3Splt8Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Alex and his wife Anna at Hong Kong Disneyland.</figcaption></figure><p>By 2014, Alex had finished business school, and had started a career in digital marketing.</p><p>But Alex’s interactions with the developers around him at work made him realize something important. He was missing a core entrepreneurial skill. He needed to learn to code.</p><p>Alex had no real programming experience. He couldn’t afford the time or the money necessary to attend a coding bootcamp — let alone to go back to school for a computer science degree.</p><p>But he decided to learn to code anyway. Every day after work, Alex would teach himself to code using free online resources.</p><p>While using freeCodeCamp, he decided he wanted to code along with other friends to have more social accountability. He tried to join a freeCodeCamp group in Toronto, but there wasn’t one. So he created one.</p><p>The freeCodeCamp Toronto study group expanded quickly through his efforts to organize events. The group started out meeting in coffee shops. Soon it was filling up entire office spaces. And it eventually found a permanent venue at a nearby coworking space.</p><p>And through freeCodeCamp Toronto, Alex became friends with dozens of like-minded people who wanted to learn to code.</p><p>All his hard work paid off. Thanks to his newly acquired skills and large network of developers, Alex got his first developer job.</p><p>At that point, it was easy to become complacent. He had arrived.</p><p>He had a fun job. He was making good money. He had made so many friends. And he had “made it.” He was a Russian expatriate finding success in Canada’s biggest and most competitive city.</p><p>But Alex knew he needed to keep expanding his skills if he wanted to realize his entrepreneurial ambitions. He could sense his skills hitting a plateau. After a long day at work, it was tempting to just relax and watch TV, or hang out with friends.</p><p>Alex recalls:</p><blockquote>“The idea of #100DaysOfCode originally came from personal frustration with my inability to consistently learn to code after work. I would find other less-involved activities to spend my time on, like binge-watching TV series.<br><br>One of those days, I was sitting in a restaurant with my wife Anna sharing my frustrations with her. I suggested that maybe I should make a public commitment to learning for at least an hour every day, and I thought I would go for 3 months.<br><br>Anna said it was a good idea, and asked: ‘But why stop at 3 months? You should make it an even 100 days! It just sounds better!’”</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-100daysofcode-challenge-is-born\">The #100DaysOfCode Challenge is born</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/1_9VTiBSaOZuTDHr0FQUc8Pw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/1_9VTiBSaOZuTDHr0FQUc8Pw.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/1_9VTiBSaOZuTDHr0FQUc8Pw.png 697w\"><figcaption>I got to hang out with Alexander Kallaway in person in Toronto.</figcaption></figure><p>#100DaysOfCode would serve as a commitment device, forcing Alex to code each day after work, even when he felt like watching TV instead.</p><p>He needed to clearly state what the rules of the challenge were, so he wouldn’t be able to bend them later.</p><p>So he created <strong>Rule #1: You commit to coding for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days.</strong></p><p>Alex was obsessed with productivity, and developing positive habits. He had read lots of books on habit formation. Some of the books he recommends reading on the topic are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CFS8R0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005CFS8R0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=out0b4b-20&amp;linkId=570b829f1e6f6ebf8a2fb6a65a8c5500\" rel=\"noopener\">The War of Art: Winning the Inner Creative Battles</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EJSMC8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B007EJSMC8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=out0b4b-20&amp;linkId=b0333d9cb4da4f50f1fe7825fcadc803\" rel=\"noopener\">The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K5JUNSU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00K5JUNSU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=out0b4b-20&amp;linkId=03640190aae8d90e97e04fffa7d39c04\" rel=\"noopener\">The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph</a></li></ul><p>Alex thought about how so much of our motivation comes from our friends and family. We need social accountability.</p><p>And that’s when he realized that this challenge could be social in nature, and that the more people he got involved, the more likely any single participant would succeed and make it through day 100.</p><p>So he created <strong>Rule #2: You commit to encouraging at least 2 other people who are taking the challenge each day, using Twitter.</strong></p><p>As Alex puts it:</p><blockquote>“This system could help counteract all the excuses I naturally came up with for not doing what I was supposed to do. This is how the challenge was born — a couple of simple rules, social accountability, and nothing more. Accountability is one of the biggest factors in trying to change some aspect of your life.”</blockquote><p>Right from the start, Alex acknowledged that learning to code is hard. But our friends can help us push forward through the setbacks.</p><blockquote>“There will be plenty of times when you feel like you’ve had enough. Or you’ll feel like your progress is way too slow, or you’re hopelessly stuck. These are all serious-enough reasons to quit. Or at least that’s what you might tell yourself.<br><br>But if you connect with others on the same path you can share the ups and downs of the journey, and together move past all these roadblocks. Share your frustrations, learning experiences, and victories with the like-minded people who are also on the same path as you. By sharing these, you grow to understand: ‘It’s not just me.’”</blockquote><h3 id=\"why-100daysofcode-is-a-more-realistic-goal-than-most-of-the-new-years-resolutions-people-commit-to\">Why #100DaysOfCode is a more realistic goal than most of the New Years Resolutions people commit to</h3><p>The #100DaysOfCode Challenge is only 100 days long — less than a third of a year. And you have a giant community of people cheering you on.</p><p>As a result, many people not only finish the challenge — they commit to it a second time!</p><p>So Alex came up with the concept of “rounds.” These are signified by tweeting with which day you’re on (Day 1) and how many times you’ve attempted the challenge (Round 1).</p><p>He adopted a new format for daily progress tweets: <strong>R1D1 </strong>— which means <strong>R</strong>ound <strong>1</strong> <strong>D</strong>ay <strong>1</strong>.</p><blockquote>“There is an inside joke that was born out of this format: On the second day of the second round — R2D2 — people post a picture or a gif of the beloved R2D2 Star Wars robot in their daily progress tweet.”</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Hw7O2KfPe3OOUpt0L9W1Pg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>If you scroll through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23100daysofcode&amp;src=typd\" rel=\"noopener\">the #100DaysOfCode hashtag on Twitter</a>, you’ll see cases where people have already completed several rounds.</p><p>But Alex recommends starting with a single 100-day commitment and going from there. He also recommends keeping things simple at the start.</p><blockquote>“New Years Resolutions don’t work because people over-commit. Make sure this is your only habit that you’re trying to pick up.”</blockquote><p>He also says it’s OK if something unexpected comes up, and you can’t code for a day.</p><blockquote>“If you are traveling for 2–3 days and cannot code, take a book on coding with you and read it instead. If you only can afford 20 minutes a day, do that. Make the challenge your own. The only rule that I want you to keep sacred is that you have to code daily. You can skip a day here and there for unplanned situations, but not more. The goal is to become consistent, no matter what life throws at you.”</blockquote><p>If you’re interested in boosting your motivation, you should take the challenge. It starts with tweeting your commitment to the challenge.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27m%20publicly%20committing%20to%20the%20%23100DaysOfCode%20Challenge%20starting%20today.%20Join%20me!&amp;url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d&amp;hashtags=100DaysOfCode\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to publicly commit to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge</a> 😇</p><p>Then you can fork the <a href=\"https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code\" rel=\"noopener\">#100DaysOfCode GitHub repository</a> to serve as a journal of your daily progress.</p><p>One great thing about the challenge is that you don’t need to wait until New Years to take it.</p><p>People are starting the challenge every day, so you’ll have people who started before you cheering you on.</p><p>Then you can turn around and cheer on the people who are starting after you.</p><p>These encouraging tweets and feedback on your projects can be extremely motivating.

    "excerpt": "Way back in June 2016, I got an email from a developer named Alexander Kallaway.\n\nI knew of Alex because he’d created the freeCodeCamp Toronto study group. It was\none of the most active study groups in Canada, drawing crowds of developers each\nweek.\n\nBut Alex wasn’t writing me about the Toronto study group. He was writing me\nbecause he wanted to tell me about an endurance challenge he’d dreamed up.\n\nThe challenge was this: Alex wanted to code for at least an hour every day — for\nthe next 100 day",

    "html": "<p>This week we live-stream the 2020 Reactathon – a 3-day React conference – for free on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.</p><p>Reactathon (also known as the San Francisco React Conference) usually takes place in downtown San Francisco in March. You can probably guess why they postponed it this year. (It starts with P-A-N-D and doesn't eat bamboo.)</p><p>The good news is the conference was fully online, and you can watch all the talks right now, safe from the comfort of your own home.</p><p>Note that for each conference talk listed below, I've included the introduction segment by conference MCs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnjanaVakil\">Anjana Vakil</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jcutrell\">Jonathan Cutrell</a>. These are no ordinary MCs – they are both icons of the software development field.</p><p>Jonathan is best known as the host of the popular <a href=\"https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea\">Developer Tea podcast</a>. And Anjana has given a number of particularly influential conference talks on JavaScript-related topics, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo0qiGPSV-s\">like this one</a>.</p><h2 id=\"reactathon-2020-day-1-talks\">Reactathon 2020 Day 1 Talks</h2><h3 id=\"guillermo-rauch-talk-on-next-js\">Guillermo Rauch talk on Next.js</h3><p>Day 1 started off with a keynote from Guillermo Rauch, founder of Vercel (formerly Zeit) and co-creator of the popular Next.js full stack development framework.</p><p>Guillermo is one of the most exciting figures in JavaScript at the moment, and I think you'll dig his keynote. </p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=3304\">You can watch Guillermo's talk here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"lydia-hallie-talk-on-javascript-v8\">Lydia Hallie talk on JavaScript V8</h3><p>Then Lydia Hallie walked everyone through how the JavaScript V8 engine works.

    "title": "The Story of MyCodeSchool: Tragedy, Triumph, and Two Friends Who Changed Programmer Education Forever",
    "slug": "mycodeschool-youtube-channel-history",
    "html": "<p>I first started learning to code in 2012. And there was one YouTube channel that all my friends used to learn algorithms and data structures: MyCodeSchool.</p><p>Within minutes of watching MyCodeSchool, you could immediately tell that:</p><ol><li>These developers were really passionate about computer science. And</li><li>They were exceptionally good at teaching it.</li></ol><p>At the time, I was a 31-year old teacher trying to get my first job as a software engineer. And like most people, I watched the videos. I took notes. And eventually I went on my merry way.</p><p>It was only years later that I noticed MyCodeSchool had stopped publishing videos. And I discovered the tragic reason why.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/_24__mycodeschool_-_YouTube.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>MyCodeSchool's YouTube channel, which – aside from a single video published in 2016, went dark nearly 6 years ago.</figcaption></figure><p>The more I dug, the more I realized how important this story was. And now I am going to share that story.</p><p>I'm also going to share with you some never-before published photos and insights from the early days of MyCodeSchool.</p><p>Every developer should learn this story of friendship between these two teachers, and how they – for a short time – took the programming world by storm.</p><p>This story is sad. But it is also inspiring. And I feel honored to relay it to you.</p><p>Here's how Harsha and Animesh took decades worth of computer science wisdom and made it easily accessible to millions of students around the world.</p><h2 id=\"the-monkey-with-his-hand-stuck-in-a-jar\">The Monkey With His Hand Stuck in a Jar</h2><p>Animesh Nayan was a mediocre student who rarely attended class. He was a \"last bencher\" who was only able to pass school because his friends would cover for him when his professors took attendance.</p><p>But Animesh loved programming. And he was good at it. Outside of his classes, he immersed himself in the world of algorithms, data structures, and systems design.</p><p>Animesh became so good in fact that he was able to land a coveted job as a software engineer at Microsoft right out of school.</p><p>I spoke with Animesh at length, and told me his views on Indian higher education bluntly: \"We graduate a large number of computer science engineers every year, but only 15 to 20% of them are employable in the IT-enabled services industry. And only 3% of them are employable in IT product companies, which require a deeper understanding of computer science concepts like data structures and algorithms.\"</p><p>\"With the current standard of computer science education, we are catering to the industry more in terms of quantity and less in terms of quality.\"</p><p>And as fate would have it, tackling this \"quality problem\" Animesh had identified would become the central focus of his life.</p><p>But he wouldn't realize that until nearly 5 years later, after going through the motions at Microsoft. He was good at his job, but it wasn't his calling. This was what society wanted for him. It was not what he wanted for himself.</p><p>\"First I was trying to make my father happy by getting good grades and getting a good job. Then I was trying to make my manager at work happy by fixing 20 software bugs in a week. I was bored of seeking validation and not being connected to my inner self. I thought, people take me seriously if I told them I work for Microsoft. But what is my identity beyond that?\"</p><p>Animesh likened his predicament to a monkey who had reached into a jar to grab some peanuts. In order to pull his hand out, he had to let go of some of the peanuts. But the monkey's instincts prevent him from doing this, so he just stays there, stuck. (And yes, this is a real-life method used to trap monkeys.) </p><p>\"Quite often when it comes to life, we behave like these monkeys. We hold on to something like a source of money even when it’s making us miserable.\"</p><p>But working for Microsoft did bring him prestige and made him famous among his extended family. Many of his friends and relatives who were struggling through computer science programs reached out to him asking for mentorship. They hoped to reproduce Animesh's success for themselves. And Animesh did his best to help them.</p><p>\"I figured out that most of them do not have good fundamentals, and they lack in what I'll call the core skill in computer science - programming.\"</p><p>He saw what Salman Khan had accomplished through his math videos on Khan Academy, and thought he could do something similar for programming and computer science. </p><p>\"My approach was to make a complex computer science concept easy to understand with a good script. I would spend weeks just thinking about how to simplify and explain an algorithm in the best possible way.\"</p><p>In 2012, he publishing his first 15-minute lecture to YouTube.</p><p>\"I felt embarrassed listening to my own voice. But my wife encouraged me, so I published it anyway. Surprisingly not many people were teaching computer science in easy to understand language back then. My video was soon ranking at top for a query like 'time complexity'. I felt encouraged and created some more videos.\"</p><p>By mid 2012, he had published several videos, and fellow programmers began reaching out to collaborate. But Animesh had his sights set on one programmer in particular – his long-time friend and fellow IIIT Allahabad graduate, Harsha Suryanarayana.</p><h2 id=\"the-humble-fool\">The Humble Fool</h2><p>Harsha was no ordinary unemployed computer science grad. He was a legendary competitive programmer. He was well-known not just around campus, but internationally.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/340972_10150660281930031_1399512724_o.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/340972_10150660281930031_1399512724_o.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/340972_10150660281930031_1399512724_o.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Harsha Suryanarayana</figcaption></figure><p>Here are some of Harsha's achievements:</p><ul><li>He got a perfect score on all 3 of his ICSE exams.</li><li>He represented India at the ACM's International Collegiate Programming Contest.</li><li>He achieved the \"red\" ranking on Top Coder, and was the highest ranked Indian programmer on the entire competitive programming platform.</li><li>And he was the first Indian ever to qualify for a Google Code Jam.</li></ul><p>Harsha's reputation was such that his friends referred to him as \"Lord Harsha.\"</p><p>But Harsha himself preferred to go by a less grand handle: \"Humblefool.\"</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oaQO0nL8GGgKVlBAYF_GXHijeJx7B8CLauJIg6QM0zfw8gVPtIOha5jGAt3SJ2gtczh7SPqBadBsMvItCy72Iq57uarXtnfEJY7cr45IeSs-u5IxGqbnuWnV-6a5gFqHCc4DjWu_\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Harsha (left) at ACM ICPC World finals</figcaption></figure><p>Animesh says of Harsha: \"I had tried competitive programming too, and my rating was not even half of his. I remember writing an email and telling him about MyCodeSchool and thinking that he would be too busy to reply.\"</p><p>But Harsha called him the next day. And he was full of ideas for MyCodeSchool.</p><p>Instead of getting a job at a big software company like Animesh had done, Harsha had been busy conducting programming bootcamps for computer science students. And Harsha invited Animesh to come and assist him in teaching one.</p><p>\"His boot camps were not getting the kind of response I expected. He talked really fast and probably assumed that some concepts and details were too trivial to bother explaining. Even though he was the nicest guy, many students weren't participating and felt too stupid to ask questions. Harsha sensed that too, but did not know how to break the barriers and shift his frame of reference. He needed to lower his assumptions and get in a good flow with everyone in the class.\"</p><p>And that is where Animesh saw an opportunity. He didn't know half of the computer science that Harsha knew. But he was good at breaking concepts down and explaining them. He suspected they could make them a powerful team. And he soon got a chance to put this assumption to the test.</p><p>The Microsoft India Development Center wanted Harsha and Animesh to help train and onboard their new hires. Harsha created the coding challenges and Animesh focused on the presentation. They looked for ways they could gamify the experience, add humor, and get students to work in teams.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CySEhsD4T0Ug3OPxUVKG8OTh816axyq4SJsxdVES-SFsuhzr0BBD3Wbgnrz_rwDZRf9uDG-72eghVcws89PaZXQsnZf5sjNSuEjnzZqDLienkwZ3h11xV5tdCVCSlM_bpwGVjWic\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Animesh (second from right) with participants from one of his bootcamps</figcaption></figure><p>Their bootcamp got a standing ovation and high marks from participants, and Microsoft wanted to hire them for more training. It was great validation for Harsha and Animesh's team-based teaching approach. But they had their sights set on something much larger than corporate training.</p><p>They spent the next year teaching competitive programming.

It was June 15, 2014. I got an email from Microsoft inviting us to conduct another bootcamp for them. I wanted to discuss it with Harsha and so I called him that evening. He did not pick up. I called him a few times, but no response. He would call back soon as he always does, I thought.\"</p><p>The next morning, Animesh got a call from a friend telling him to check the local news. </p><p>Harsha and his wife, Neha, had been crossing the street at night when a car slammed into them. Neha was in the hospital, and would ultimately recover from her injuries. But Harsha wouldn't. The doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival. He was only 32 years old.</p><p>\"What? Are you sure it’s our Harsha?\" Animesh recalled. \"I couldn’t believe it. But the news was true. I was devastated.\"</p><p>There was an immediate outpouring of grief across the competitive programming community.</p><p>Top Coder dedicated a match in his honor.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>TopCoder dedicated a match to Harsha's memory. At the time, Harsha was the highest-rated TopCoder member in the algorithm track in all of India.</figcaption></figure><p>Animesh said of his friend at: \"Harsha has chosen to go to heaven because God needed a genius programmer there.\"</p><h2 id=\"life-after-mycodeschool\">Life After MyCodeSchool</h2><p>Animesh reflected on that period of his life. \"The next few months were very hard. I tried to continue, but felt lonely, sad, and overwhelmed.\"</p><p>Animesh decided he needed a change of pace. His wife was working at Google in India, and was able to transfer internally to the US. \"I thought, why not. This may be a good change. Silicon Valley is a really exciting place and I had always wanted to experience it.\"</p><p>Within a few months, Animesh had gotten offers from tech giants like Facebook. Today he works as an engineer on Google's search team, working on both the Google and YouTube search engine algorithms.</p><p>Speaking with Animesh as he sat at his kitchen table, surrounded by his family, he told me: \"I am a father of 2 wonderful kids now and life is good. But, there is a force that keeps creating an inner conflict in me. Everyday, I get some emails in my inbox thanking me for MyCodeSchool and asking me why I don't create videos anymore.\"</p><p>\"I do not know what to say. I want to get back to teaching, but it’s just hard. I want to give a lot of time to my kids and it’s not possible to get back to it unless I quit my regular job and do it full time. This force is growing everyday. Maybe it will lead me back to my passion for teaching once again. I do not know yet.\"</p><p>Then Animesh's thoughts return to Harsha, and he recalls a conversation they had. \"I was being the typical entrepreneur and asking him to think about scaling so we could reach many more. And he said something interesting. Maybe we can just inspire a few people to teach, and they can inspire few more to teach and the chain would grow. We need far too many motivated teachers, and it can’t be just us anyway. It’s like being a candle that can light up some more candles. Something inspired the two of us and put that light in us. We were not the first and we won’t be the last. We only are the intermediate links in this chain.\"</p><h2 id=\"the-spirit-of-mycodeschool-lives-on-in-the-freecodecamp-community\">The Spirit of MyCodeSchool Lives On in the freeCodeCamp Community</h2><p>I often wonder what would have happened if Harsha were still with us, and if he and Animesh were still experimenting with new ways of teaching programming and computer science.</p><p>One thing is for sure: we will remember the work of Harsha and Animesh, the time they spent together, and the ground-breaking courses that resulted.</p><p>I speak for many teachers when I say that their work has inspired me, and that communities like freeCodeCamp would not exist without the vision of these pioneers.</p><p>Animesh has given me permission to publish several anthologies of some of MyCodeSchool's best algorithm and data structure explanations on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. Starting in December, we will publish several full-length courses derived from MyCodeSchool's archive of computer science courses.</p><p>I am honored to help bring the teaching of these two legendary teachers to a new audience of aspiring developers. </p><p>In closing, I want to share this anecdote Animesh mentioned in my conversations with him:</p><p>A student, aware of Harsha's genius, asked him why he chose to spend all of his time teaching others.</p><p>Harsha thought for a while and said, “I have always liked the stories where an underdog wins. I just want to be part of one of those stories.”</p>",

Just hit the <code>return</code> key to run the selected search.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Mitch_Murder_-_Salary_Man_Simulator_OST_-_YouTube_---1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"You can use the up and down arrows to select a search query to run.\"><figcaption>You can use the up and down arrows to select a search query to run.</figcaption></figure><p>You can collapse the search box and its search predictions dropdown menu by hitting the <code>escape</code> key.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-2-how-to-pause-and-unpause-a-youtube-video-with-a-hotkey\">Keyboard Shortcut #2: How to Pause and Unpause a YouTube Video with a Hotkey</h3><p>You can pause and unpause a video by pressing the space bar or the <code>k</code> key.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-3-how-to-go-full-screen-on-youtube-using-a-hotkey\">Keyboard Shortcut #3: How to go Full Screen on YouTube Using a Hotkey</h3><p>You can go full screen at any time by pressing the <code>f</code> key. And you can get out of full screen by hitting the <code>f</code> key again (or hitting the <code>escape</code> key).</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-4-how-to-mute-a-youtube-video\">Keyboard Shortcut #4: How to Mute a YouTube video</h3><p>You can mute YouTube at any time by pressing the <code>m</code> key.</p><p>You can unmute by then hitting <code>m</code> a second time.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-5-how-to-speed-up-a-video-or-slow-it-down-by-changing-the-playback-speed\">Keyboard Shortcut #5: How to Speed Up a Video or Slow it Down by Changing the Playback Speed</h3><p>YouTube offers 8 playback speed options:</p><ul><li>0.25x</li><li>0.5x</li><li>0.75x</li><li>Normal</li><li>1.25x</li><li>1.5x</li><li>1.75x</li><li>2.0x</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/_1__Mitch_Murder_-_Salary_Man_Simulator_OST_-_YouTube_---3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>YouTube's Playback Speed Menu, accessible by clicking the gear and choosing \"playback speed\"</figcaption></figure><p>This is an important feature for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>If you are in a hurry, you can watch YouTube at a faster rate and save time. I personally watch most videos at 2.0x speed.</li><li>But if the video is in a language you don't know very well, you may want to watch it slower. For example, whenever I watch videos in Non-English languages like Spanish or Japanese, I may slow it down to 0.75x or 0.5x speed so it's easier to understand what people are saying.</li><li>If you are learning a musical instrument, slowing down the video speed can make it much easier to keep up with the teacher and follow along, or read musical notes. I often start a piece of music at 0.5x speed, then advance it to 0.75x speed and eventually normal speed.</li><li>You can turn any 80s pop song into a Vaporwave song by slowing it down to 0.5x speed. It's safer than hitting yourself in the head. ?</li></ol><p>You can access these speed controls by clicking the YouTube gear, then choosing \"playback speed\" and changing it from there. But this requires 3 or 4 clicks.</p><p>It's much faster to use the playback speed control hotkeys:</p><ul><li>press <code>shift + .</code> to speed up a video by 25%</li><li>press <code>shift + ,</code> to slow down a video by 25%</li></ul><p>You can just hold the hotkey down to max out to 2.0x, or or min out the speed at 0.25x.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-6-how-to-advance-a-youtube-video-frame-by-frame-or-go-back-a-frame\">Keyboard Shortcut #6: How to Advance a YouTube Video Frame-by-Frame or Go Back a Frame</h3><p>YouTube lets you step through videos frame-by-frame if you want to.</p><p>First, press the space bar or <code>k</code> to pause the video. Then press <code>.</code> to go forward a frame, or <code>,</code> to go back a frame.</p><p>If you hold down one of these keys, you'll make your own super slow mode or super slow rewind effect, which can be kind of fun with sports videos.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-7-how-to-restart-the-youtube-video-at-the-beginning-or-jump-forward\">Keyboard Shortcut #7: How to Restart the YouTube Video at the Beginning, or Jump Forward</h3><p>You can use the numbers 0 - 9 to jump to different points in a YouTube video.</p><p>Pressing <code>0</code> will restart the video, and pressing <code>5</code> will jump to the exact middle of the video. Pressing <code>9</code> will take you to the final 10% of the video.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-8-how-to-turn-on-closed-captions-or-subtitles\">Keyboard Shortcut #8: How to Turn on Closed Captions or Subtitles</h3><p>Some YouTube videos have auto-generated closed captions for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.</p><p>These can also be helpful if you're watching a video in your non-native language. They can also turn a YouTube viewing session into an impromptu karaoke session.</p><p>You can toggle these on or off at any time by pressing the <code>c</code> key.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/_1__Billy_Idol_-_Dancing_With_Myself__Official_Music_Video__-_YouTube_--.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>You can change the language of the captions, too. But to do this you'll need to use your mouse and click the gear icon.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-9-how-to-rewind-or-fast-forward-5-seconds-or-10-seconds-\">Keyboard Shortcut #9: How to Rewind or Fast Forward 5 Seconds (or 10 Seconds)</h3><p>You can use the left and right arrows to rewind or fast forward 10 seconds. You can hold these down to jump past entire sections of the video (or use the number hotkeys I introduced a moment ago).</p><p>These arrow keys jump forward and backward exactly 5 seconds.</p><p>But did you know you can also jump forward and backward in 10 second increments of time? You can do this with the <code>j</code> and <code>l</code> keys, respectively.</p><p>One way to easily remember this is to treat the <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, and <code>l</code> buttons as rewind, pause/play, and fast-forward, respectively.</p><p>It's kind of silly that YouTube has two different methods for this, but as a keyboard shortcut aficionado, I'm not complaining.</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-10-how-to-turn-up-and-turn-down-the-volume-of-a-youtube-video\">Keyboard Shortcut #10: How to Turn Up and Turn Down the Volume of a YouTube Video</h3><p>Sure, Your keyboard may have its own volume controls. But what if you want to just turn down a YouTube video's volume so you can listen to some jams during an over-long Zoom call?</p><p>Well YouTube gives you an easy way to adjust the volume for just YouTube videos: the up and down arrows.</p><p>There are 20 different volumes you can listen to YouTube at (5% increments).</p><h3 id=\"keyboard-shortcut-11-how-to-play-the-up-next-video-or-next-video-in-a-playlist-\">Keyboard Shortcut #11: How to Play the Up Next Video (or Next Video in a Playlist)</h3><p>If you hit <code>shift + n</code> you can skip the current video entirely and start playing YouTube's \"Up Next\" video.</p><p>If you happen to be watching a playlist, this will take you to the next video in the playlist.</p><p>And as a little bonus hotkey: if you happen to be in the middle of a playlist, you can hit <code>shift + p</code> to move to the previous video in the playlist.</p><p>And now that I've covered those helpful keyboard shortcuts, here are a few helpful shortcuts that will require you to use the mouse.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-access-youtube-s-secret-right-click-menu\">How to Access YouTube's Secret Right Click Menu</h2><p>YouTube also has a secret right-click menu. This is different from your browser's normal right-click menu, and only shows up when you right-click a video itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-put-a-youtube-video-on-repeat-using-the-loop-option\">How to Put a YouTube Video on Repeat Using the Loop Option</h3><p>If you right-click a video, YouTube will give you the option of turning on \"Loop.\" This will cause the video to repeat over and over until you close the tab or turn the option off.</p><p>This is a helpful feature for when you want to listen to a song or album over and over (like I am while writing this.)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Mitch_Murder_-_Salary_Man_Simulator_OST_-_YouTube.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"how-to-access-youtube-video-stats-for-nerds\">How to Access YouTube Video Stats for Nerds</h3><p>YouTube also gives you quite granular data on your network speed and video playback.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/_1__Mitch_Murder_-_Salary_Man_Simulator_OST_-_YouTube_--.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"You can access these stats by right-clicking the video then choosing &quot;Stats for nerds&quot; from the drop-down menu.\"><figcaption>You can access these stats by right-clicking the video then choosing \"Stats for nerds\" from the drop-down menu.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, you can see the current resolution of the YouTube video, your current connection speed, volume, and \"buffer health.\"</p><p>YouTube doesn't have much in the way of how Buffer Health is calculated, but it seems to represent how well the video is able to pre-load with your current connection.</p><h2 id=\"youtube-keyboard-shortcuts-can-save-you-so-much-time-if-you-practice-with-them-\">YouTube Keyboard Shortcuts can save you so much time if you practice with them.</h2><p>I hope these tips will help you save time and feel more powerful while using YouTube.</p><p>freeCodeCamp (the nonprofit I founded back in 2014) has hundreds of programming tutorials on YouTube.

They each just use a slightly different URL structure.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-create-a-subscribe-link-if-your-youtube-channel-is-classified-as-a-channel\">How to Create a Subscribe Link if Your YouTube Channel is Classified as a Channel</h3><p>You can tell your channel uses the \"channel\" structure by visiting your channel and seeing whether it has the word \"channel\" in the address bar.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><pre><code>https://www.youtube.com/channel/freecodecamp</code></pre><p>See the word \"channel\" here? So in this case, you can use this structure for your link:</p><pre><code>https://www.youtube.com/channel/&lt;YOUR CHANNEL ID&gt;?sub_confirmation=1</code></pre><p>You would just replace the <code>&lt;YOUR CHANNEL ID&gt;</code> in this URL with your channel's ID, which you can find by going to your YouTube channel. </p><p>It will either be a custom name (in this case, <code>freecodecamp</code>) or it will be a string of base-64 characters like this: <code>UC0syIz79dzjMXIf5VdJ65EA</code></p><p>Once you add your channel ID to that link, you'll be good to go. The people who click that link will not only be taken to your channel, but they'll also see the subscription confirmation prompt.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-create-a-subscribe-link-if-your-youtube-channel-is-classified-as-a-user\">How to Create a Subscribe Link if Your YouTube Channel is Classified as a User</h3><p>Some older channels are still set up as users rather than channels. You can tell your channel uses the \"user\" structure by visiting your channel and seeing whether it has the word \"user\" in the address bar.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><pre><code>https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston</code></pre><p>This channel is set up as a user.</p><p>In this case, you would use this structure:</p><pre><code>https://www.youtube.com/user/&lt;YOUR CHANNEL ID&gt;?sub_confirmation=1</code></pre><p>You would just replace the <code>&lt;YOUR CHANNEL ID&gt;</code> in this URL with your channel's ID.

YouTube gives you a way to embed subscribe buttons directly into your website.</p><p>Here is what one of these buttons looks like:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Configure_a_Button_-_-_YouTube_Subscribe_Button_-_-_Google_Developers.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>This is a static image that leads to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/freecodecamp?sub_confirmation=1\">a subscribe prompt</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>And here's the embed-able HTML code you would add to your blog. Note that this code will import Google's <code>platform.js</code> JavaScript library in order to dynamically show the button and your current subscriber count.</p><pre><code>&lt;script src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"g-ytsubscribe\" data-channelid=\"&lt;YOUR CHANNEL ID&gt;\" data-layout=\"full\" data-theme=\"dark\" data-count=\"default\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>You can embed this code. Be sure to replace <code>&lt;YOUR CHANNEL ID&gt;</code> with the channel ID you see when you visit your page. </p><p>If you have a custom YouTube channel URL like <code>https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp</code> you may be able to use that as your channel ID, but I find it more reliable to use the full channel 24-character ID.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-customize-your-youtube-subscribe-button\">How to Customize Your YouTube Subscribe Button</h2><p>There are two other ways you can customize your subscribe button.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-show-your-channel-name-and-logo-in-your-subscribe-button\">How to Show Your Channel Name and Logo in your Subscribe Button</h3><p>You can change <code>data-layout</code> to be either <code>default</code> or <code>full</code> (which will show your channel name and icon).</p><p>Here is what this looks like when you set <code>data-layout=\"default\"</code>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Configure_a_Button_-_-_YouTube_Subscribe_Button_-_-_Google_Developers-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>This is a static image that would lead to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/freecodecamp?sub_confirmation=1\">a subscribe prompt</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>And here's what this looks like when you set <code>data-layout=\"full\"</code>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Configure_a_Button_-_-_YouTube_Subscribe_Button_-_-_Google_Developers.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>This is a static image that leads to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/freecodecamp?sub_confirmation=1\">a subscribe prompt</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also set the theme to dark with <code>data-theme=\"dark\"</code>.</p><p>And you can hide your subscriber count completely with <code>data-count=\"hidden\"</code>. If you only have a handful of subscribers, you may want to hide this for a few months while you build up a thousand subscribers or more, to avoid \"negative social proof\".</p><h1 id=\"why-i-recommend-youtube-subscribe-links-instead-of-youtube-subscribe-buttons\">Why I Recommend YouTube Subscribe Links Instead of YouTube Subscribe Buttons</h1><p>There are several reasons why I recommend using the link approach instead of these dynamic buttons.</p><ol><li>Ad blockers, firewalls, and browser plugins may block the button from rendering correctly or from working correctly. This button does involve pulling a JavaScript file from Google's CDNs, which means it won't render in China, for example, where Google is currently blocked.</li><li>It is hard to control the styling of these buttons, and they may end up looking bad on a mobile device.</li><li>These buttons may lead to accessibility issues. The link, on the other hand, is just a link, and is easy for people to use in screen readers or other assistive tools.</li></ol><p>But Google does support these YouTube subscription buttons as well, so it's up to you whether you want to use them.</p><h2 id=\"a-youtube-subscribe-button-customization-tool\">A YouTube Subscribe Button Customization Tool</h2><p>Google has an official tool for customizing these YouTube subscribe buttons. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube_subscribe_button\">You can access it here</a>. Note that you will still need to have access to the HTML of the page you want to embed these buttons into.</p><p>Thanks for reading this guide, and I hope it has helped you understand how these YouTube subscribe links and buttons work, and how you can use them to get more people to subscribe to your channel.</p><p>If you want more tips on being a successful YouTube creator in general, you can learn from our nonprofit's 5+ years of experimentation that has helped us become the largest programming channel on YouTube. </p><p>Here's our <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-start-a-software-youtube-channel/\">free YouTube handbook, which also includes a 1 hour video course</a>. We designed it with software-focused creators in mind, but many of the techniques can be applied to other subject domains. I hope it's helpful for you.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>– Quincy</p><p></p><p></p>",

I liked designing logos at that time, and decided to write a logo design tutorial to see if I could hit the front page.

I decided to record a few tutorials throughout the first several years. I never checked stats or took it seriously. </p><p>\"In 2014, I saw I had around 6,000 subscribers and decided to get really serious by uploading regularly.

    "html": "<p>Most coding games are aimed at children. But there are also some great coding games aimed at adults who want to learn to code.</p><p>Don't get me wrong – there's nothing wrong with using the games on Code.org or Khan Academy. You can learn Scratch, which is a programming language designed to help kids learn concepts like loops and variables. Some of those games even teach basic Python or JavaScript.</p><p>But if you're a fully-grown adult, it may be harder to get excited about a kid-themed game like Minecraft or Disney's Frozen. You may instead want to find more serious games that can keep you engaged while you learn.</p><p>If this describes you, well I've got good news. This list is chock-full of games where you'll make meaningful strategic decisions, then execute them through code.</p><p>Note that all of the games on this list are fine for kids, too. But their primary audience is adult learners.</p><p>Let's dive in.</p><h2 id=\"best-coding-games-pick-1-sql-murder-mystery\">Best Coding Games Pick #1: SQL Murder Mystery</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/08/The_SQL_Murder_Mystery.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Upon starting SQL Murder Mystery, you receive some basic instructions:</p><blockquote>\"A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help.

    "title": "After 5 Years of Fun Fun Function, Coding Legend MPJ Moves On to His Next Big Journey",
    "slug": "funfunfunction-mpj-developer-journey",
    "html": "<p>5 years ago, Mattias Petter Johansson – better known as MPJ – was already a well-known developer.</p><p>He had made a name for himself by answering hundreds of coding questions <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Mattias-Petter-Johansson/answers\">on Quora</a>. And he had gone from theater student to prolific developer, having built a product that was acquired by Blackberry.</p><p>So in the summer of 2015, MPJ was working at the height of his field as a front-end developer at Spotify in his native Sweden.</p><p>And that's when he decided – seemingly out of nowhere – to launch a programming YouTube channel. </p><p>I distinctly remember sitting in my parent's living room with some hot tea when his first video went live. And of course I clicked on it. Because how can you not click on a video called Fun Fun Function?</p><p>\"Hello!\" MPJ shouted exuberantly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk\">in his first video</a>. \"In this video series, I will teach you how to do functional programming in JavaScript.\"</p><p>Little did any of us know at the time that this \"video series\" would stretch on for 5 years, span more than 200 episodes, and ultimately become MPJ's full-time focus.</p><h2 id=\"gifting-the-developer-community-a-trove-of-coding-fun\">Gifting The Developer Community a Trove of Coding Fun</h2><p>In addition to functional programming, MPJ covered lots of other programming topics.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/maxresdefault--1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pmGFGoiyUI\">video on Lua</a>, a popular language for game development that is frequently taught in high schools.</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the show, there were two reliable fixtures: MPJ's high energy, and his ever-changing hair color.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Redux creator and React maintainer Dan Abramov came on Fun Fun Function to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-aO5hzo1aw\">discuss React Hooks with MPJ</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, MPJ did cross-overs with some of the most exciting teachers in tech.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/maxresdefault--2-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>An episode where MPJ teamed up with coding live-streamer and mechanical keyboard aficionado Noopkat to do some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkn-GzSksYA\">LED strip hardware hacking with JavaScript</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>He also shared lots of insights around how to break into the field of software development, and how to continue to progress with your career.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/maxresdefault--3-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>MPJ talks with career coaches Ingrid Kocjan and Megan Vallee about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWwuL6o366A\">career advancement as a developer</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"all-good-things-must-come-to-an-end\">All Good Things Must Come to an End</h2><p>So today, it was with mixed emotions that I watched his final video.</p><p>If you have 15 minutes, I encourage you to watch the video – even if you've never watched his channel before. Because this is a master class in how you responsibly and decisively bow out of a long-running project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IfHWE36B1go?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>MPJ's final Fun Fun Function video.</figcaption></figure><p>I probably learned more about MPJ and what kind of person he is from this video than I did from all his other zany, thoughtful videos combined.</p><h2 id=\"no-matter-how-good-you-are-you-can-still-get-better\">No matter how good you are, you can still get better</h2><p>MPJ is a passionate developer who loves coding and loves teaching. All of this shines through in his videos. But he is also someone who sees his life's work as largely unfinished.</p><p>He has the humility to realize the limits of his own abilities, and to continue exploring and expanding past them.</p><p>As he explains in his final video:</p><blockquote><em>\"When I started Fun Fun Function I was still at Spotify, and it was a little bit of an outlet for me to talk about musings while I was at Spotify building.</em><br><br><em>And when I went full time [on Fun Fun Function], all I was doing was talking about creating – not actually creating. When I did create, it was tools that facilitated creation – Twitch overlays and stuff like that.</em><br><br><em>Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing way to spend my time. I heard from thousands of people how I've helped them become better and more inspired developers by sharing my passion and knowledge with the world. </em><br><br><em>But I think that now, 5 years later, I'm out of things to share.</em><br><br><em>I've shared all of the stuff that I learned during my time working as a programmer. And I've also lost a little bit of the passion for the craft itself, like coding. And so I can't really contribute with much enthusiasm either at this point. </em><br><br><em>So now it's time for me to go back to the place where you all are.\"</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"a-higher-calling\">A Higher Calling</h2><p>Most importantly, MPJ wants to play a part in addressing an important challenge facing humanity – the challenge of mental health.</p><p>He explains:</p><blockquote>\"I want to go back to building products, putting things out into the world, and spend some time thinking about what it is that I care about. What is it that I should be creating?<br><br>I care about a lot of things. But one thing that sticks out lately is psychology and mental health. <br><br>I don't talk much about this on the channel, but when I was in my late teens, my mother committed suicide. It was after a very long battle with chronic depression and addiction to benzodiazepines.<br><br>During the last year or so I've been going to therapy myself, facing a lot of inner demons that have been there for many many years. And as I've done this I've realized what a big, interesting, important problem mental health is. I've grown the opinion that mental health is an area that way more people should be working on. <br><br>Globally more than 800,000 people commit suicide every year. In almost all countries, suicide is a more common way to die than homicide – sometimes 10 or 20 times more. Every 40 seconds someone commits suicide.\"</blockquote><p>We may not get any more Fun Fun Function videos, but it is heartening to know that people like MPJ are out there working hard on the big problems facing humanity.</p><p>And I will always be grateful for the many insights MPJ has left us with.</p><p>You can browse <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/funfunfunction/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid\">the full archive of his Fun Fun Function videos here</a>.</p><p>And Mattias – if you're reading this – Godspeed on your future endeavors. Programmer YouTube won't be the same without you.</p>",

    "html": "<p>I'm about to tell you something that will shock you, and probably make you very angry. I hope you won't hate me for it. Here goes.</p><p>If you are an iPhone user, everything you have copied to your clipboard on your iPhone can be secretly accessed by various apps. These apps often record the contents of your clipboard several times a minute, and send them to their company servers to store for eternity.</p><p>Think about all the things you copy to your clipboard. Links. Passwords. Private messages to your friends and family.</p><p>All of these things are being stolen from you and sent to the data centers of multinational corporations, who will use it to figure out what ads to show you so they can make more money.</p><p>And that is just the best case scenario. There's no way to know for sure what they are using your clipboard data for.</p><p>Apple has known about this for a long time. And they are just now taking steps to restrict apps' access to your clipboard, and to notify you when an app accesses the contents of your clipboard.</p><p>This was never an issue for Apple until privacy advocates started raising awareness of this earlier this week.</p><p>Here's an insane supercut of several well-known apps stealing the contents of your clipboard (which now triggers a notification in the newest version of iOS.)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRSWdtoUAjo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Some apps, like TikTok, use this clipboard exploit even while running in the background to steal every single character you type into any app.</p><p>Here's an example of this discovered when Apple started showing clipboard notifications in the iOS 14 beta:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">iOS 14 beta has a banner to confirm when you paste from another device (eg copy on a Mac and paste on iPhone)<br><br>Seems to be bugging out and showing with every keystroke in TikTok <a href=\"https://t.co/aFKNfZnpyb\">pic.twitter.com/aFKNfZnpyb</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Burge (@jeremyburge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyburge/status/1275832600146391042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 24, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>Apps can even use this clipboard exploit to get your location data without you ever granting them permission.

How many sensitive things do you do on your laptop every day? How many passwords to you copy/paste from your password manager? How many emails do you type up? How many websites do you copy/paste to share through private messages? </p><p>All of that is going to your clipboard, which is getting shared with your iPhone, which can then be accessed by various companies through their iPhone apps, and stored in their servers around the world.</p><p>This \"feature\" is called Universal Clipboard or \"Handoff.\" And it is enabled by default on every Mac. </p><p>For your privacy, I recommend you turn this feature off immediately. It only takes a few seconds. Here's how to do this.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-turn-off-universal-clipboard-handoff\">How to Turn Off Universal Clipboard Handoff</h1><h2 id=\"step-1-open-spotlight-search-\">Step #1: Open Spotlight Search.</h2><p>By default, you can open MacOS Spotlight Search by pressing the command key and spacebar at the same time.</p><p>Then type the word \"Handoff\" and double click the \"General\" option that appears under \"System Preferences\" in the list below.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/Spotlight_and_How_to_Turn_Off_Universal_Clipboard_Handoff_on_your_Mac_and_iPhone__and_why_you_should__-_freeCodeCamp_org.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A screenshot of Apple Spotlight Search</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"step-2-uncheck-handoff-\">Step #2: Uncheck Handoff.</h2><p>A menu will pop up when you click \"General\" under the \"System Preferences\" option.

You've just turned off Universal Clipboard Handoff.</h1><p>My advice would be to uninstall all the apps that have been stealing information from your clipboard without your consent. </p><p>These apps have violated your trust by abusing this \"vulnerability\" in iOS. (I put the word vulnerability in quotes because, again, Apple has known about this for a long time and initially refused to do anything about it.)</p><p>Here's a list of apps who have been caught red-handed stealing your clipboard data:</p><pre><code>10% Happier: Meditation \n5-0 Radio Police Scanner \n8 Ball Pool\nABC News\nAccuweather \nAl Jazeera English \nAliExpress Shopping App \nAMAZE!!!\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond\nBejeweled\nBlock Puzzle \nCBC News \nCBS News \nClassic Bejeweled \nClassic Bejeweled HD \nCNBC \nDazn \nFlipTheGun\nFox News\nFruit Ninja\nGolfmasters \nHotel Tonight\nHotels.com \nLetter Soup \nLove Nikki \nMy Emma \nNew York Times\nNews Break\nNPR \nntv Nachrichten \nOverstock \nPigment – Adult Coloring Book \nPlants vs. Zombies\nPooking – Billiards City\nPUBG Mobile\nRecolor Coloring Book to Color \nReuters \nRussia Today \nSky Ticket \nStern Nachrichten \nThe Economist \nThe Huffington Post \nThe Wall Street Journal \nThe Weather Network \nTomb of the Mask: Color\nTotal Party Kill \nTikTok\nTruecaller\nViber\nVice News \nWatermarbling\nWeibo\nZoosk</code></pre><p>And last but not least, change your passwords! Assume that these passwords have been intercepted by these clipboard-thieving apps are now in private data centers all over the world.</p><p>Sure – these companies are unlikely to use your passwords. But they may eventually get hacked. And hackers might try to exploit your passwords or sell them to even worse actors.</p><p>It breaks my heart to learn of this. It's been going on for maybe years.</p><p>And in case you're curious, Android is just as permissive with letting 3rd party apps access your clipboard data.</p><p>Switching to Android won't save you, but switching to a feature phone might, if that's a sacrifice you're willing to make. Me? I just uninstalled basically all 3rd party iPhone apps and use <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brave-private-web-browser/id1052879175\">the Brave browser</a> or the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337\">Firefox Focus browser</a> for everything.</p><p>It really is a jungle out there.

    "title": "Python Certifications are Now Live, and Other freeCodeCamp Version 7.0 Curriculum Updates",
    "slug": "python-curriculum-is-live",
    "html": "<p>freeCodeCamp's core curriculum now offers 10 verified certifications – including 4 Python-focused certifications.</p><p>These certifications are all self-paced and completely free. You can build the projects right in a browser, or code them on your laptop or phone and deploy them to the cloud.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-freecodecamp-certifications-work\">How do freeCodeCamp certifications work?</h2><p>All of the lessons and projects are publicly available. You don't even need to create a freeCodeCamp account to access them. But if you want to save your progress and eventually earn certifications, you will need to create an account.</p><p>Note that all accounts are private by default. freeCodeCamp.org takes privacy seriously, and we have <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/privacy-policy/\">a well-documented privacy policy</a>. You can make your profile public in the settings, and can choose to make any certifications you earn publicly accessible as well.</p><p>Here's how these certifications work:</p><p>Each certification includes optional lessons to help you prepare for its 5 required projects.</p><p>When you feel ready, you can build the certification's 5 required projects and get all of their automatic tests to pass.</p><p>Once you've built all 5 projects, you can go into settings, accept freeCodeCamp's Academic Honesty Pledge, and claim your certification.</p><p>You get the certification immediately, and it lives on freeCodeCamp's servers at a permanent URL that you can put on your LinkedIn, résumé, or personal website.</p><p>Our bots will eventually audit all of your projects to check for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty. If our bots flag anything suspicious, our team will manually review it. And if we determine you cheated, we'll revoke your certifications and permanently ban your account. So don't cheat. You'd only be cheating yourself. ?</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-new-certifications\">What are the new certifications?</h2><p>Here are the 6 certifications we introduced back in 2018. These focus on Full Stack Web Development using JavaScript:</p><ol><li>Responsive Web Design</li><li>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</li><li>Front End Libraries</li><li>Data Visualization</li><li>APIs and Microservices</li><li>Quality Assurance</li></ol><p>These are still the best place to focus in 2020, and represent the broadest programming foundation and fastest path to a developer job.</p><p>This said, there are a lot of other skills we've wanted our curriculum to cover since day one. And we are thrilled to now add these to the curriculum as four new Python-focused certifications. Here they are:</p><ol><li>Scientific Computing with Python</li><li>Data Analysis with Python</li><li>Information Security</li><li>Machine Learning with Python</li></ol><p>Again, these are more advanced certifications. They assume that you have already completed the first 6 certifications. And thus have a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, APIs, and other concepts.</p><p>I recommend you work through the entire curriculum from start to finish, so you can learn one language really well (JavaScript) before moving on to a second language (Python). </p><p>Now, you may be thinking: \"but I heard that Python is a more beginner-friendly language than JavaScript.\" There are <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-19a33b0a467d/\">a number of reasons why many people recommend learning JavaScript first</a>.</p><p>Each of these certifications has 5 required projects – each with its own test suite.</p><p>These projects can be built wherever you want. We recommend using Google's Colaboratory for the Machine Learning projects. It's a hosted Jupyter Notebook tool, and it's free and runs in the browser.</p><p>For the rest of these Python certification projects, we recommend using REPL.it. It's fast, free, and easy to use.</p><p>Each of these projects includes a link to a boilerplate that you can fork to get started.</p><p>If you want to code these projects on your local computer, you can clone these repositories. But you will need to host your solutions publicly on the open web so you can submit them and claim your certifications.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-is-coming-soon-for-version-7-0-of-the-curriculum\">What else is coming soon for Version 7.0 of the curriculum?</h2><p>As we <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-curriculum/\">announced last December</a>, we are working toward a completely project-oriented curriculum. Instead of individual coding lessons, you will learn by building projects the entire time.</p><p>We are building more than 60 optional practice projects, such as:</p><ul><li>\"Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game\"</li><li>\"Learn Express.js by Building an Stock Trading Platform\"</li><li>and \"Learn Network Security by Building a Packet Sniffer\"</li></ul><p>In total, completing the entire freeCodeCamp curriculum will involve building more than 100 projects over the span of 3,000 hours. This is roughly the amount of time it would take to earn an associate's degree.</p><p>We are making steady progress on these projects. We are also updating our learning platform to make these more elaborate projects build-able right on freeCodeCamp.org.</p><p>As always, we don't have a ship date for these. We hope to push them to production the moment they're ready, and not a moment sooner. ?</p><p>You will notice that for the 4 new Python certifications, instead of having interactive lessons (like we have for the first 6 certifications) we have lecture-based courses. These courses are well-taught, and we are confident you'll learn a lot from them. Note that they are placeholders for our upcoming practice projects.</p><p>If you find the Python certification projects to be overwhelming, you may want to supplement your learning with other resources, such as our hundreds of free courses and tutorials on Python, data analysis, machine learning, and security. And you can ask programming questions and get feedback on your projects on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/The_freeCodeCamp_Forum.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A screenshot from our forum</figcaption></figure><p>I want to thank the dozens of kind alpha testers who successfully built these 20 new projects and provided their feedback and improvements.</p><p>So yes, these projects can be built. And their tests can be passed. But you may be one of the first 100 or so people to have done so. If you encounter any bugs or confusing instructions, we encourage you to open a GitHub issue with your feedback.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-general-timeline-for-the-upcoming-60-practice-projects\">What is the general timeline for the upcoming 60+ practice projects?</h2><p>We will focus on rolling out the practice projects for the 4 new Python certifications first. These will replace the placeholder lectures in each certification.</p><p>Then we will replace the interactive lessons from the first 6 certifications with practice projects.</p><p>Remember that – aside from the 50 certification projects that are now live – all the lessons and practice projects are completely optional. You do not need to go back and complete them as we add them to the curriculum unless you want to. You can earn all 10 certifications starting today, by building each project's 5 required projects.</p><p>There is no reason to delay starting the curriculum. These practice projects will cover essentially the same skills and tools as the curriculum currently covers. They will just be more fun, interactive, and engaging, with even more repetition to help you better retain these concepts. </p><p>None of this is magic. You would learn all of these things from just practicing coding and building projects on your own anyway. The key to learning to code well is practice.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*gxqZjvLgyl_AQNSD17Eu2Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Comic by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DoodleTimeSarah/\" rel=\"noopener\">Sarah Andersen</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>And freeCodeCamp gives you a single linear curriculum to practice in way that is both time efficient and sane.</p><p>You can check out <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn\">the full freeCodeCamp curriculum and its 10 certifications here</a>.</p><p>Happy coding. ?</p>",

Once they do this, I will link to it here, and I may have some additional data visualizations.</p><p>For this article, I am sharing Stack Overflow's official data visualizations, along with my own analysis of them and their significance.</p><p>First, this article will first cover demographics: age, educational background, and how long people have been coding.</p><p>Second, I'll cover the tools developers use most often, and the tools they're the most excited about.</p><p>Finally, I'll cover developer salary and job satisfaction.</p><h2 id=\"how-old-is-the-average-professional-software-developer\">How old is the average professional software developer?</h2><p>Most professional developers are in their late 20s or early 30s.

A lot of professional developers didn't go to college.</li><li>But most professional developers did go to college.

This figure is probably much higher than it would have been 10 years ago.</p><h2 id=\"how-developers-use-different-technologies-in-tandem\">How developers use different technologies in tandem</h2><p>One of the coolest parts of this year's Stack Overflow survey is this data visualization, which shows the tools developers most commonly pair with other tools.</p><p>Here are the clusters. The size of each circle corresponds to the proportion of survey respondents who use the tool:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>This network graph shows the relationships between usage of different tools. You can see several distinct ecosystems emerging.</figcaption></figure><p>It should be no surprise that Ruby and Rails tend to get used together, or that .NET developers tend to develop on Windows machines and Azure Cloud.</p><p>But there are some interesting observations we can make here, too. The fact that MySQL is more closely associated with PHP, for example, is a reminder that the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is still a widely used toolchain.</p><p>Contrast this with MongoDB, which seems to be most widely used with JavaScript ecosystem tools.</p><p>Angular embraced TypeScript back in 2015, and it is now more commonly associated with TypeScript than it is with JavaScript.</p><p>Dart started out as a web development tool at Google. Rather than being incorporated into Angular, it is now more commonly associated with mobile app development, thanks to the surging popularity of the Flutter framework.</p><p>In the upper left hand corner, we also get some insight into the tools that DevOps and Site Reliability Engineers use most. We can even see the overlap with the whole data science and machine learning fields.</p><p>The conclusions I'm drawing from this chart may be overly broad. I am excited to dig into Stack Overflow's full dataset once they release it, and see whether the data bears out these observations.</p><h2 id=\"how-often-do-developers-learn-new-technologies\">How often do developers learn new technologies?</h2><p>Professional developers pick up new tools often. Nearly ¾ of them seem to learn at least one new technology every year.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-11.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>35% of developers learn a new technology every few months. That's much faster than in most professions, where Continuing Professional Education may constitute just a few days worth of learning each year.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"working-life-what-percentage-of-developers-are-self-employed\">Working life: what percentage of developers are self-employed?</h2><p>A vast majority of professional developers work for an employer. Less than 10% of them were self-employed or working as freelancers or contractors when surveyed in February 2020.</p><p>Also note that 1 out of every 8 respondents were students, but even some of those students identified as professional developers. These students may have gotten internships or even full-time developer jobs while still finishing school.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-12.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>83% of professional developers work at an organization.</figcaption></figure><p>Most developers work at small or medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Only about 35% of them work at companies with more than 500 employees.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Nearly 2/3rds of developers work at companies with fewer than 500 employees, and only 13.9% work at large companies.</figcaption></figure><p>For some perspective, out of the FAANG software companies, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple all have more than 10,000 employees. Netflix had just under 10,000 employees in 2019, and probably has more than that now. Microsoft, which isn't included in FAANG for some reason (maybe it would make the acronym unpronounceable?) also has more than 10,000 employees.</p><p>My point is that all of these \"name brand\" software companies and their peers only employ about 14% of developers. Most developers are working at companies you haven't heard of. Many of them aren't even working at tech companies, but rather at banks, hospitals, and local governments. As of 2020, Pretty much every Fortune 1000 company has software engineers on staff.</p><p>Less than half of respondents considered their company's new developer onboarding process to be \"good\".</p><p>But about 65% of them were satisfied with their jobs.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-15.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Nearly 1/3rd were \"very satisfied.\"</figcaption></figure><p>The main consideration that spurs developers to start looking for new jobs? Money. Not a huge surprise there.</p><p>But what is surprising is that  a desire to work with new technologies came in second – above growth and leadership opportunities and work/life balance.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-16.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>\"Trouble with teammates\" and \"trouble with leadership at my company\" were relatively uncommon reasons for people to want to leave. This would seem to suggest that most developers are chasing opportunity rather than fleeing unhappy workplaces.</figcaption></figure><p>And when it comes to job satisfaction, \"Languages, frameworks, and other technologies I'd be working with\" was the main consideration for most developers. But... only for men.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-19.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For the 3,694 women who responded to the survey, \"office environment and company culture\" was the most important consideration. The technologies they'd be working with were a tertiary consideration.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>There are some other differences as well. Diversity was a much more important consideration for women.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-average-developer-salary-in-2020\">What is the average developer salary in 2020?</h2><p>Here's a really cool data visualization from the report. The Y axis is median salary, and the X axis is years of programming experience. Study this for a moment:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-20.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>If you want to get a high wage earlier in your career, it would seem that DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering are your golden tickets.</p><p>But before you rush out to start reading Linux <code>man</code> pages, I would be remiss to not point out: all of the jobs here fall between 7 and 12 years of professional programming experience.</p><p>One mistake I often see people make is to prematurely specialize. Your first developer job is unlikely to be as a DevOps engineer. Most likely, it will be as a full stack developer. You'll specialize on-the-job from there, according to the work your bosses assign to you.</p><p>But this chart is a helpful guide, because of the sheer volume of responses and the resulting statistical significance. And it may give you some ideas for what types of dev team responsibilities you should ask your boss for.</p><p>Also keep in mind that these numbers are global. Here is the difference between salaries globally and salaries here in the US, which has traditionally been the highest-paid developer market in the world.</p><p>First, global salaries for different roles, based on 34,279 survey responses (in US dollars):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-22.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Management is still the best-paying job description represented here, with SRE coming in second.</figcaption></figure><p>Now here are the United States wages for different roles, based on 8,006 responses:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2020-21.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Management and SRE are still the highest paid jobs in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>US developers earn a $60,000 premium over their non-US counterparts across the board.</p><p>One thing you'll note from looking at these charts: back end developers in the US seem to average about $8,000 more than full stack developers do, but full stack developers make slightly more outside the US. </p><p>I'm not certain why this is, but I speculate this is because the US software industry is older than in most other countries. Thus it has a higher degree of job specialization. Since full stack development is a superset of back end development, many of today's full stack developers will specialize on the job and become tomorrow's back end developers.</p><h2 id=\"those-are-all-my-highlights-from-stack-overflow-s-2020-developer-survey\">Those are all my highlights from Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey</h2><p>Thanks for reading.

    "title": "Alt Codes – How to Type Special Characters and Keyboard Symbols on Windows Using the Alt Keys",
    "slug": "alt-codes-special-characters-keyboard-symbols-windows-list",
    "html": "<p>In Windows, you can type any character you want by holding down the ALT key, typing a sequence of numbers, then releasing the ALT key.</p><p>You can type a lot of characters that may not have a corresponding key on your keyboard – such as European language alphabetic characters, ASCII symbols, and even Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi, Kanji, or Hanja).</p><p>These Alt codes are also helpful if you have a keyboard with a stuck or missing key.</p><p>Below I will break down the entire list of alt keys by category. But first, here's the full list. (Note: this does not include the many, many characters from non-western European languages – otherwise it would be 100,000s of codes long.)</p><p>Below is a nice ASCII-formatted table of the most commonly-used symbols and characters. It took me a while to assemble all of these get them looking good.</p><p>As a developer, when I search for these codes I often get results that are image-based. These are inaccessible to people with visual disabilities, and make it hard for everyone to copy-paste the codes.</p><pre><code>\n  Alt Code   Symbol  \n ---------- -------- \n  alt 1      ☺       \n

    "excerpt": "In Windows, you can type any character you want by holding down the ALT key,\ntyping a sequence of numbers, then releasing the ALT key.\n\nYou can type a lot of characters that may not have a corresponding key on your\nkeyboard – such as European language alphabetic characters, ASCII symbols, and\neven Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi, Kanji, or Hanja).\n\nThese Alt codes are also helpful if you have a keyboard with a stuck or missing\nkey.\n\nBelow I will break down the entire list of alt keys by ",

It should render the same regardless of which language your users' browsers are set to.</p><p>Some of symbols these have easier-to-remember codes.

It captures your entire screen. And for privacy reasons, you may not want to do this.</p><p>Also, some laptops don't even have a Print Screen Key on their keyboard.</p><p>Fortunately, Windows also has a more powerful built-in screen-shot tool called Snip &amp; Sketch.

You can then left-click your mouse and drag your cursor – which will now be shaped like a little crosshair.</p><p>The portion of the screen that you've selected will be brighter than the rest of the screen.</p><p>Then, whenever you've selected everything you want to screenshot, just release these keys. Presto – you have taken a screenshot.

Coming from the Mac and Linux world, there is no equivalent tool that works this well for those operating systems.</p><p>Thanks for reading this guide. I for one take dozens of screenshots per day. And I hope you are able to also embrace this convenient way of capturing information and quickly sharing it with people. Screenshots are a great way to quickly communicate.</p><p>Have a fun day, and happy snipping.</p>",

And I hope these other tutorials I've shared with you here will help you go from zero-to-sixty within the coming months.</p><p>The key is to keep practicing and not get discouraged by how many Vim shortcuts there are to remember. Eventually, all of these will become muscle memory, and you'll be flying from one file to another, banging out code like a terminator.</p><p>There is now feeling quite as cool as being able to drop into a codebase and immediately start making changes without every even reaching for a mouse or trackpad. That is the power that Vim promises, and delivers in spades.</p>",

April may be even longer.</p><p>I hope you and your family are staying safe during this pandemic.</p><p>I realize that in the coming months, many of us face the prospect of losing a loved one to this disease. And many of us will contract this disease ourselves, and will struggle to overcome it.</p><p>The doctors, nurses, scientists, and other front line folks are doing the urgent work of helping us get through the pandemic with as few deaths as possible.</p><p>We teachers at freeCodeCamp are doing much less urgent work. We are creating free online resources so you can expand your skills, improve your career options, and provide for your families.</p><p>So again – I want to acknowledge that this is a hard time. It is OK to just focus on your family, and your own well being.</p><p>But if you do want to learn some new technology skills, and get a firmer grasp on theory, we're here to help.</p><p>And toward that goal, I have 3 big announcements today to help you achieve this.</p><h1 id=\"announcement-1-lockdownconf-a-free-online-developer-conference\">Announcement #1: #LockdownConf - A Free Online Developer Conference</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/_LockdownConf_-_A_free_online_conference_to_help_you_prepare_for_a_post-pandemic_world.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>freeCodeCamp is hosting a free online developer conference on our YouTube channel on April 14. That's right – it's only a few days away.</p><p>Here are the topics we'll cover during this 4-hour conference:</p><ol><li>How to learn new skills while social distancing</li><li>How to work from home productively and stay sane</li><li>How to find companies who are still hiring and apply for developer jobs</li><li>How to land freelance work during the pandemic</li></ol><p>My friend Fazle (co-founder of Hashnode.com) and I will MC the conference. We'll have panels of developers from all over the world sharing their insights and answering your questions.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lockdownconf-free-developer-conference/\">learn more about the conference, and add it to your calendar here</a>.</p><h1 id=\"announcement-2-our-new-aws-developer-associate-certification-course-is-now-live\">Announcement #2: Our New AWS Developer Associate Certification Course is Now Live</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/RrKRN9zRBWshd-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>In January we announced <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/awscertified-challenge-free-path-aws-cloud-certifications/\">our #AWSCertified challenge</a>. Since then, tons of developers have committed to studying for and earning AWS cloud certifications.</p><p>And this week we launched our 3rd free course on AWS certification exams. This one is for arguably the hardest associate-level exam: The Developer Associate Certification.</p><p>This free 16-hour course covers:</p><ul><li>DynamoDB</li><li>Elastic Beanstalk</li><li>Serverless with AWS Lambda</li><li>and a lot more topics.</li></ul><p>You can <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pass-the-aws-developer-associate-exam-with-this-free-16-hour-course/\">learn more about the Developer Associate Certification course and take it here</a>.</p><h1 id=\"announcement-3-the-new-freecodecamp-discord-chat-room-server-is-live\">Announcement #3: The New freeCodeCamp Discord Chat Room Server is Live</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/5b10829e1ae6621c008b49e6.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>freeCodeCamp's forum grew dramatically in March. We had to upgrade to an even bigger server. Twice.</p><p>The forum is great for asking and answering questions. This said, a lot of people have asked for a sort of \"water cooler\" type chat room where they can socialize while social distancing.</p><p>So we've created a Discord server where you can hang out during the day while you work and learn new skills.</p><p>This is a friendly, inclusive chat room for the developer community And we need positive energy now more than ever.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-discord-chat-room-server/\">learn how to join freeCodeCamp's Discord chat room server here</a>.</p><h1 id=\"i-hope-all-this-brightens-your-april-a-bit-\">I hope all this brightens your April a bit.</h1><p>We are making steady progress on <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-curriculum/\">our expanded curriculum</a>, and publishing lots of other free courses – like this <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/\">2-hour course taught by developer Aina Kubow where you build 7 minimalistic JavaScript games, including Tetris</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/jsgames-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>We will keep these courses coming.</p><p>My personal goal in life is to make sure that you never run out of well-taught, timely, free learning resources.</p><p>As always, you can support our nonprofit's efforts (and help us pay for servers) <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\">by donating</a>. Every little bit helps.</p><p>Here's wishing you and your families safe passage through this tumultuous time, and better days ahead when we all emerge from this.</p><p>– <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/ossia\">Quincy</a></p>",

And now we can hang out together in chat and keep each other company.</p><p>As you may know, freeCodeCamp already has a forum. Millions of people use it each month.</p><p>If you ask a programming question there – or ask for feedback on one of your projects – you can usually get a response in about an hour.</p><p>The forum will continue to be the best place to talk productively about programming.</p><p>But we also wanted to create a place where people in the community could hang out and chat more casually.</p><p>In the past we've used HipChat and Slack. And we're still using Gitter.im as a chat tool to coordinate open source contributions to our codebase.</p><p>Discord is really on the next level, though. Over the past few years, Discord has proven itself to be a fast, flexible, robust chat room tool.</p><p>Our friends at <a href=\"https://www.reactiflux.com/\">Reactiflux</a> have more than 80,000 people on their server, so we know that Discord can scale to suit a big community like freeCodeCamp.</p><p>We're starting out with just a few chat rooms.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Michigan State&#39;s architects planted grass - then waited to see where students wore down paths - before paving sidewalks.

Forums are better-structured for getting programming help, because they're threaded and easier to search. (Fun fact: for every one person who asks a question on the forum, 100+ other people have that same question and are able to discover the thread through Google, so they don't have to re-ask the question.)</li><li>The developer community is global. People in every country on Earth use freeCodeCamp. (Yes – even North Korea.) Please keep the discussion in English for now, even if that isn't your native language. You can share ideas for improvements and integrations in the #meta-discord channel.</li></ol><p>OK – if you read all that, you are now officially cleared to join freeCodeCamp's Discord chat room.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA\">join it here</a>.</p><p>Be sure to introduce yourself in our #Introductions channel. Tell us anything about yourself you feel comfortable sharing: </p><ul><li>what city you're in</li><li>what projects you're working on</li><li>and what you're planning to do once we have all gotten vaccinated for this terrible disease, and we're all able to go outside again.</li></ul><p>I'm looking forward to chatting with you all.</p><p>I hope you and your families stay safe during the pandemic. </p><p>And, as always, happy coding.</p>",

    "html": "<p>I'll cut right to the chase: the word \"data\" is plural. It's the plural form of Latin word \"datum.\" Many data. One datum.</p><p>Datum means \"a given\" or \"something that should be taken into consideration.\"</p><p>Nobody really uses the word \"datum.\" Instead people say \"data point\" to represent a single unit of data.</p><p>So yes – when developers and data scientists say: \"the data <em>suggest</em> these two phenomena are correlated\" instead of \"<em>suggests</em>\"<strong> </strong>– they are in-fact using the word \"data\" correct.</p><p>This is not a matter of being cheeky. There is a single objective reality we all live in. And in that reality, the word \"data\" is plural.</p><h2 id=\"but-it-s-ok-for-people-to-say-the-data-is-instead-of-the-data-are\">But it's OK for people to say \"the data <em>is</em>\" instead of \"the data <em>are</em>\"</h2><p>It really is.</p><p>Life is too short for this kind of nitpicking.</p><p>I often hear people who work with data use the wrong subject-verb agreement for the word data. I don't correct them. Because I don't want them to dismiss me as pedantic. Or to take this as some form of deeply-felt criticism.</p><p>And I recommend you don't correct people on this, either.</p><p>You can keep sailing through life, saying \"data are\" while all your colleagues continue to say \"data is.\" You can feel a smug satisfaction that – deep down inside – you are right and they are wrong.</p><p>Who knows. Maybe one day your boss will approach you one-on-one after a team meeting. They'll say:</p><blockquote>\"You know – I always thought it was strange that you said \"the data <em>are</em>\" when everyone else I know says \"the data is.\"<br><br>But I looked it up. And you were right. You've been right all along, and it was us who were wrong.<br><br>And yet you didn't correct us. <br><br>You are a really cool, magnanimous person. You deserve a promotion and a pay raise.\"</blockquote><p>OK – maybe not that last part.</p><p>But it feels good to say it correctly, doesn't it?</p><p>Eventually all the people who keep saying it wrong will look the word \"data\" up in the dictionary. They too will come to see the light.</p><p>This isn't some crazy hard irregular verb we're talking about. (Just try correctly conjugating the phrase \"to lie down\" for past and past participle, and you'll see what I mean.)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/maxresdefault--10-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Lay VS Lie explained.

Thousands of children died from this virus, and many more suffered life-long paralysis.</p><p>No one was safe from this horrible disease. Even US president Franklin D. Roosevelt contracted it at age 39. He spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair.</p><p>Enter Jonas Salk, a medical researcher who had mainly studied flu viruses before turning his efforts toward Polio.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*kMJd6ibAkYC27DuDQDDicQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Jonas Salk in 1959</figcaption></figure><p>Dr. Salk spent 7 years assembling a team of researchers and working to develop a Polio vaccine.</p><p>He conducted the most extensive field test ever, involving what historian Bill O’Neal says were “20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers.”</p><p>The vaccine was a success. So Dr. Salk set to work immunizing everyone on Earth. He pushed the marginal costs of the Polio vaccine as low as possible — to just the raw materials necessary — by forgoing any financial benefits his intellectual property would have brought him.</p><p>When asked about his patent, he said, “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?”</p><p>Dr. Salk stared down a massive problem and threw himself into it with everything he could, without any aspiration for personal gain. And in the process, he and his colleagues basically wiped out one of the worst diseases ever.</p><p>Today, everyone’s life is better off as a direct result of this one massive free lunch.</p><blockquote>“The reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more.” —Dr. Jonas Salk</blockquote><h3 id=\"free-lunches-are-important\">Free lunches are important</h3><p>Before I run through some modern-day examples of free lunches, let me give you some background on myself, and why the notion of a free lunch is so important to me.</p><p>I run a nonprofit, open source community where you can learn to code, practice by building software for nonprofits, then get a job as a developer. Thousands of people have gotten developer jobs so far. And it’s free.</p><p>I was so committed to the idea of it being free that I put the word “free” in the name.</p><p>Free can mean both <strong>libre</strong> — free as in free speech, and <strong>gratis</strong> — free as in free beer. Just like the “free” in “Free Open Source Software” (FOSS), the “free” in “freeCodeCamp” means both of these.</p><p>But still, every day I encounter people who are skeptical. They tell me they don’t use freeCodeCamp because “it sounds too good to be true.”</p><p>“There’s no way all this can be free,” they say. “I’ll sign up and give you my email address, and only then will I find out that I need to pay $20 a month, right?” Or: “You’re free for now, but soon you’ll throw up ads and paywalls, like everybody else does.”</p><p>Well, I’ve said this publicly a hundred times, and I’ll say it publicly again: <strong>freeCodeCamp will always be free.</strong></p><p>We operate on the fringe of capitalism. The frontier where marginal costs asymptotically approach zero, and the very laws of classical economics begin to unravel. A place called the <strong>abundance economy</strong>.</p><p>And we’re not alone.</p><h3 id=\"low-overhead-engineering-with-lichess-org\">Low overhead engineering with lichess.org</h3><p>Meet Thibault Duplessis, the founder of <a href=\"http://lichess.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">lichess.org</a> — the second most popular chess website on the planet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*Mf6j9-uvZ6pj0gLi.\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Thibault Duplessis</figcaption></figure><p>As of <a href=\"https://en.lichess.org/blog/VgwCfhwAAB8AbzkK/100000000-games-played\" rel=\"noopener\">a year ago</a>, lichess had 78,000 unique daily visitors, who play a total of 260,000 games of chess each day.</p><p>Thibault has no employees. He doesn’t even work on lichess full-time. He still has a job at a development consultancy.</p><p>Lichess’s main competitor, <a href=\"http://chess.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Chess.com</a>, is a privately-held behemoth that makes millions of dollars each year off of banner ads and premium membership up-sells, then spends that money <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2009/12/22/419-chess-com-buys-rival-site-chesspark/\" rel=\"noopener\">acquiring their competition</a>.</p><p>Contrast this with Thibault, who has <a href=\"https://github.com/ornicar/lila\" rel=\"noopener\">open-sourced lichess’s server code</a>. He has promised that lichess will be free forever, and that it will never show ads.</p><p>But wait — how can he do this?</p><p>Because of the nature of modern web applications, and the economics of their near-zero marginal costs.</p><p>Despite lichess’s complexity — and the scale at which it operates — Thibault’s server costs are a mere $416 a month.</p><p>This cost is covered by merchandise and donations from his grateful users, who increasingly include some of the best chess players in the world.</p><h3 id=\"how-craigslist-covers-costs-by-charging-only-0-1-of-its-users\">How Craigslist covers costs by charging only 0.1% of its users</h3><p>Remember classifieds?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*OF95xt7pTgHE0D-ZgTIZNQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Classified ads in a newspaper</figcaption></figure><p>People used to pay a dollar per word for tiny ads that appeared in the backs of newspapers, sandwiched between other ads.</p><p>Then, 20 years ago, Craigslist utterly disrupted classifieds. They provided a directory of ads online, for free.</p><p>It was searchable. You could use as many words as you wanted, and include pictures. You could repost your ads as many times as you wanted, in as many nearby cities as you wanted.</p><p>But if placing ads on Craigslist was free, how did Craigslist make money?</p><p>Well, if you asked a random Craigslist user, they probably wouldn’t be able to tell you. Most people just assume that Craigslist is a nonprofit, supported by donations or something.</p><p>But Craigslist made $400 million last year.</p><p>They did it by charging to post in a few key categories within a few key cities. If you want to list an apartment in New York City, or a job in San Francisco, you have to pay Craigslist a small fee.</p><p>This means that less than one in a thousand people who use Craigslist actually pay any money to do so. Those real estate agents in New York City and those recruiters in San Francisco are paying for everyone else’s free lunch.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/08/1_RS8QWwRKrRx4LgOlXgTmvA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Craig Newmark in front of the original Craigslist HQ in San Francisco</figcaption></figure><p>Craigslist doesn’t have investors. It keeps things simple. It has a small team of about 40 people.</p><p>Craig still works at Craigslist. He handed over the role of CEO to his long-time friend so he could focus on doing what he loves: providing support for Craigslist users around the world.</p><p>Like the other people mentioned in this article, he doesn’t seem to care about money. From what I can tell, he donates most of his money through his charity <a href=\"https://craigconnects.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">CraigConnects</a>. And he spends his downtime advocating for causes he cares about, like supporting veterans and helping more women start their careers in tech.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*Fe32DDN_RKxrgqQI.\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Craigslist’s office up until a few years ago: Craig’s house.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"crowd-sourcing-contributions-with-wikipedia\">Crowd-sourcing contributions with Wikipedia</h3><p>Before Wikipedia, the most popular encyclopedia was written by paid experts, and printed in massive books. The Encyclopaedia Britannica was so expensive that they wouldn’t even tell you its price in their TV spots. (It cost $1,400.)</p><p>Jimmy Wales — Wikipedia’s visionary leader — had a better idea. He leveraged the power of the internet and the wisdom of volunteer contributors. And he made it free.</p><p>The number of volunteer-contributed articles on Wikipedia exploded. It quickly surpassed traditional encyclopedias in the scope of its content.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*RVkGuvNMhmo2nAZlbrie8Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>The number of Wikipedia articles has grown steadily since the site's founding.</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of waiting for a new physical edition to hit the press, Wikipedia editors could instantly publish updates to articles. Wikipedia was so up-to-date that many people started using it for news on current events.</p><p>Traditional encyclopedias were quickly backed into a corner. They were paying expert writers and editors to create their content. Surely this resulted in more accurate information than Wikipedia’s volunteer-driven free-for-all.</p><p>But in 2005, a major academic journal published an analysis comparing the factual accuracy of Wikipedia versus the Encyclopaedia Britannica. It found:</p><blockquote>“Jimmy Wales’ Wikipedia comes close to Britannica in terms of the accuracy of its science entries, a <em>Nature</em> investigation finds.” — The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html\" rel=\"noopener\">abstract</a> from Nature’s analysis</blockquote><p>In a last-ditch effort, The Encyclopaedia Britannica pushed back, but Nature upheld its finding.</p><p>This was the final blow to the encyclopedia industry, which had flourished for decades by selling stacks of books <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/the_encyclopedia_britannica_was_expensive_useless_and_exploitative_i_m_glad_it_s_gone_.html\" rel=\"noopener\">door-to-door to guilty parents</a>.</p><p>A decade later, Wikipedia is now the 6th most visited website on the planet. And covers its operating costs through more than $70 million in donations each year from grateful patrons.</p><p>But despite all of Jimmy’s accomplishments, people seem to be much more preoccupied with his money. Or rather, his lack-there-of.</p><p>Here’s what you get when you type “Jimmy Wales net worth” into Google:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*IRJYSRrgGj_QkTHz4TAJjA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Below this result, Google shows you pictures of people who started other large websites. Each of them has a net worth that’s <strong>five orders of magnitude larger</strong> than Jimmy’s paltry $1 million.</p><p>People have a hard time accepting that someone would set out to build something as important as Wikipedia without bothering to make money out of it.</p><p>One person went so far as to ask straight up on <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-Jimmy-Wales-rich/answer/Jimmy-Wales\" rel=\"noopener\">Quora</a>: “Is Jimmy Wales rich?”</p><p>Jimmy responded:</p><blockquote>“By any sane standard of measurement, yes, of course I’m rich. Nearly half of the people on earth live on less than $2 a day. I spend more than that on my cellphone bill.”</blockquote><h3 id=\"there-s-so-much-more-to-life-than-money-\">There’s so much more to life than money.</h3><p>Why are people so preoccupied by money, and the net worth of famous people? Because they’re operating in a <strong>scarcity mindset</strong>.</p><p>They are so preoccupied by the risk of not having enough that they can’t see the real risk: missing out on the potential for so much more.</p><p>The traditional scarcity mindset approach to creating value at scale goes something like this:</p><ol><li>Figure out a problem you can solve for a large number of people</li></ol><p>2a. If people will pay for your product, sell it to them, then re-invest the profits into growing your business (bootstrapping)</p><p>2b. If your solution isn’t something people will pay for, raise a bunch of venture capital to fund development. Once it’s big enough, make money some other way — usually by selling ads.</p><p>But there’s an alternative. An <strong>abundance mindset</strong>.</p><p>This approach shrugs off concerns for basic needs (worst case scenario, I have to get a job in fast food) and instead focuses on upside potential.</p><p>When you apply an abundance mindset, you approach problems from a different perspective. You try to identify opportunities for free lunches.</p><p>Your approach to creating value at scale will look something more like this:</p><ol><li>Figure out a problem you can solve for a large number of people</li><li>Keep costs low, fund development yourself, and ask for donations, sell merchandise, or find a few users with deep pockets who can subsidize everyone else.</li></ol><p>This is how all of these organizations I’ve discussed here operate. And this is how they can always be free.</p>",

I used to work as an English teacher.</p><p>But in 2011 – at the age of 31 – I started learning to code using free online resources.</p><p>In the 9 years since, I've worked as a software engineer at tech startups and built websites for freelance clients.</p><p>I am not special. There are millions of people like me who have successfully switched careers into software development in the past 5 years. I know this because I have helped a lot of them do this.</p><p>Five years ago, I created an online learning community called freeCodeCamp.org. Yes – *checks logo above this article* – that freeCodeCamp.org.</p><p>And as of 2020, more than 40,000 freeCodeCamp graduates have gotten jobs at tech companies, including Google, Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Spotify, and Microsoft.</p><p>Most of these people didn't have to go back to college. They didn't have to quit their retail job for 4 months to attend a coding bootcamp. They didn't even have to spend any money. They just learned to code in their free time – at night after the kids went to bed. Or on weekends when they could have been watching sports or playing video games.</p><p>Do you have free time right now? Do you have blank spots on your calendar for the next few weeks?</p><p>Great. Then you can do this, too.</p><p>I'm going to tell you how.</p><p>And remember – unlike a lot of the people out there, I'm not trying to sell you something. freeCodeCamp is a 501(c)(3) public charity. Everything's free.</p><p>You can use freeCodeCamp if you want. Or you can use some of these other resources I recommend here as well.</p><p>I just want you to succeed.</p><p>I want you to be able to go out there a few months from now and kick some post-Coronavirus ass on the job market.</p><p>So use whichever learning tools you see fit to accomplish that mighty goal. I'll be here rooting for you either way.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you want to get a new job after the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> blows over, start preparing now.<br><br>?️ Build your skills.<br><br>?

And I'll include some links to giant lists of these at the bottom of this article.</p><p>Instead I'm just going to focus on a good cross-section of courses that I think are a good use of your time.</p><p>The main skills I recommend everyone learn in 2020 are:</p><ul><li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li><li>Computer Science concepts, algorithms, data structures, and databases</li><li>Python and basic data science libraries like NumPy</li><li>Command line tools like Linux, Git, and Bash</li></ul><p>And some other skills that would be helpful:</p><ul><li>Small business basics – how to find freelance customers, how to do basic sales, accounting, legal</li><li>And job application basics – how to pass technical interviews, how to negotiate a high salary</li><li>How to earn professional certifications that can make it easier to get a developer job</li></ul><p>For each of these I'll recommend a single resource. And again, at the end of this article, I'll show you some other comprehensive lists of learning resources. So many free learning resources you can Scrooge McDuck away the rest of your life in a becoming a mad genius if you want to.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/FwUlnGszXSVDNjJ-800x450-noPad.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"learn-html-css-and-javascript\">Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2><p>These are the basic components of the World Wide Web.</p><p>For every website you visit, HTML is the bones. It provides the structure.</p><p>CSS is the skin. It provides the styling and aesthetic.</p><p>JavaScript is the muscles and organs. It does all the moving and functionality.</p><p>You can learn the basics of these – enough to build basic websites – in just a few days of self-study.</p><p>Getting really good with CSS and JavaScript will take you years. But the same goes for everything I'm going to tell you about here.</p><p>Except for HTML. You really can learn HTML in a day or two. And yes – you can build basic websites using nothing but HTML. They won't be pretty. But they will work. (We're talking about you, Craigslist.)</p><p>The best way to learn this trinity of web development languages is to earn the first 2 certifications of freeCodeCamp's curriculum. Along the way, you'll build 10 websites. That should be more than enough practice for you to check this box on your LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Again, as the name would imply, freeCodeCamp is free. It's also completely self-paced, and runs in your browser so you don't have to install anything. You can do it on your phone or tablet. But since you'll be typing a lot of code, a keyboard would make things a lot faster.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn\">start the freeCodeCamp certifications here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"learn-computer-science-concepts-algorithms-data-structures-and-databases\">Learn Computer Science Concepts, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Databases</h2><p>A lot of people freak out about computer science because they \"suck at math\" or because they took some Java course 10 years ago and hated it.</p><p>Well I've got good news for you all – computer science doesn't have to be a grind. It can be quite fun. And there's no course that does a better job of making it fun than Harvard's excellent computer science intro course, CS50.</p><p>We've published the entire course ad-free on freeCodeCamp's YouTube. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0WoVEr0-44&amp;list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmGw5fN5BQlwuug-8bDmabi\">Here's the full playlist</a>. </p><p>The course is about 17 hours worth of lectures. And along with each lecture video's description, there is a downloadable problem set that you can do to make sure you've understood everything. And there are downloadable lecture notes, too.</p><h2 id=\"learn-python-and-basic-data-science-libraries-like-numpy\">Learn Python and Basic Data Science Libraries Like Numpy</h2><p>Python is the most popular programming language for Scientific Computing – a catch-all term for statistics, data science, machine learning.</p><p>Python is the natural choice for a second programming language once you've learned some basic JavaScript.</p><p>Dr. Chuck is a professor at University of Michigan, and he's been teaching programming for decades. He created the awesome Python for Everybody course.</p><p>And we've published <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-for-everybody/\">his entire 14-hour course ad-free here</a>.

And arguably the most important library is NumPy (pronounced num-pie).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/numpy-python-tutorial/\">Here's a free, ad-free 1-hour course on NumPy</a>, complete with code repos you can use to play along at home.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/maxresdefault--8-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"learn-command-line-tools-like-linux-git-and-bash\">Learn Command Line Tools Like Linux, Git, and Bash</h2><p>When you watch Mr. Robot and other shows about developers or hackers, you will see a lot of command line interfaces that look like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/fcc_python_cli_-_default_freeCodeCamp_-_-zsh_-_174-40.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A random screenshot from my terminal on my Mac that I took a few minutes ago.</figcaption></figure><p>Developers often use command line interfaces because you can get things done much faster and more precisely than you can in a Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p><p>And there are several command line tools developers use a lot. First of all, they use Linux for servers. Many of these servers don't even have a Windows-like GUI installed on them, so you're stuck in the command line. And the command line scripting tool most Linux computers use is called Bash.</p><p>You can use Bash as a prompt for running commands. Here are some of <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/basic-linux-commands-bash-tips-you-should-know/\">the most commonly used Bash commands explained</a> (10 minute read.)</p><p>You can also use Bash for scripting. (Though these days, most people prefer Python for doing this.)</p><p>Here's a 2-hour introduction course on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAoFs75_cs\">a computer security-focused version of Linux called Kali Linux</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/linux.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>But there's another important tool that every developer should know in 2020. It was invented by the same guy who created Linux, and it's called Git.</p><p>Git is a Version Control System that helps you store the state of your code. If you make a mistake, you can easily roll back to an older version of your code. And Git makes it easy to collaborate on larger code projects with other developers, using websites like GitHub.</p><p>The best resource for learning Git is GitHub's own documentation. Here's a good article that <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/\">explains how Git works and walks you through some of the most common commands</a>.</p><h1 id=\"learn-small-business-basics-how-to-find-freelance-customers-and-do-basic-sales-accounting-and-contracts\">Learn Small Business Basics – How to Find Freelance Customers, and Do Basic Sales, Accounting, and Contracts</h1><p>Finding your first developer job is hard. You may have to apply to hundreds of jobs before you ultimately get through the interview process and get a satisfactory job offer.</p><p>Most hiring managers don't want to take a chance on an unknown applicant who's never worked as a developer anywhere else. This isn't just limited to self-taught developers – I know tons of computer science majors who just graduated and struggle to get job offers (even in a booming market for software developers).</p><p>My personal advice is – build your reputation and your network.</p><p>You can amplify your reputation by building tools for local businesses.</p><p>You can start out by doing work for local nonprofits for free. You could help a local church or mosque build their new website. Or you could help a local food bank build a new inventory system.</p><p>But if you're feeling ambitious, see if you can find a paying gig right off the bat. It's not as hard as you might think. There are tons of job boards out there with one-off contracts. You might even be able to find a gig on a local classified page. (We're looking at you again, Craigslist.)</p><p>By building your reputation as a freelancer, you already have successful projects under your belt when you go to apply for full-time developer jobs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freelance-web-developer-guide/\">This free Freelance Web Developer Guide</a> features in-depth advice from a veteran freelance developer, an attorney focused on business law, and an accountant. Think of it as \"your freelance developer business in a box.\" It's a 3-hour watch.</p><p>As far as building your network – normally I would advise people to go to local tech events, and hang out at hackerspaces and makerspaces.</p><p>But with the coronavirus out there, I instead recommend you stay home.</p><p>Go on LinkedIn and add every single person you've ever worked with or gone to school with.</p><p>If you are part of any Facebook groups or Discord servers, you could create a new group and encourage them to join it specifically for people who are planning to transition into software development.</p><p>You can also <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/social-distancing-introduction-thread-lets-stay-home-and-code-together-online/360050\">introduce yourself on the freeCodeCamp forum</a>, and start building a personal network of likeminded people who are learning to code.</p><h1 id=\"learn-job-application-basics-how-to-pass-technical-interviews-and-how-to-negotiate-a-high-salary\">Learn Job Application Basics – How to Pass Technical Interviews and How to Negotiate a High Salary</h1><p>My friend Haseeb Qureshi is a former professional poker player turned software engineer. His first-ever developer job was working at Airbnb making $250,000 per year. That is not a typo. </p><p>He was able to get job offers from Google, Twitch, Stripe, and other big companies, then play those offers against one another.</p><p><a href=\"https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/\">Here's his story of how he did this</a>, which is filled with tons of tips for what to expect during the job application process.</p><p>And Haseeb has also written a comprehensive guide to negotiating a high salary once you start getting job offers. These are a must-read and could add $10,000s to your starting salary: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer-ee17cccbdab6/\">Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer</a> (20 minute read)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation-c46bb9bc7dea/\">How Not to Bomb Your Offer Negotiation</a> (30 minute read)</li></ul><h2 id=\"learn-how-to-earn-professional-certifications-that-can-make-it-easier-to-get-a-developer-job\">Learn How to Earn Professional Certifications That Can Make It Easier to Get a Developer Job</h2><p>Most recruiters and hiring managers operate on pattern recognition. They famously <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/you-in-6-seconds-how-to-write-a-resume-that-employers-will-actually-read-fd7757740802/\">spend an average of 6 seconds looking at each résumé</a>.</p><p>Professional certifications are an easy way to prove to employers that you know a technology. They also increase the likelihood of you coming up in employers' résumé search tools.</p><p>You don't have to get professional certifications. They do cost money (usually about $100 to $200 per exam). But if you do want to earn some, I recommend starting with cloud certifications.</p><p>Pretty much every major company and government on earth is in the process of moving from their own servers to cloud servers. And you can become part of the huge effort to securely do so. If you want to work in DevOps or Site Reliability Engineering, these cloud certifications are a good way to go.</p><p>freeCodeCamp is publishing new free cloud certification courses each month, and eventually we'll cover security certifications as well.</p><p>But for now, I recommend starting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) certifications. Amazon owns more than half of the public cloud industry, and pretty much every Fortune 500 company uses AWS in some capacity or another.</p><p>I wrote this <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/awscertified-challenge-free-path-aws-cloud-certifications/\">comprehensive guide to AWS cloud certifications</a>, which includes several comprehensive free (and ad-free) courses to prepare you for these exams.</p><h2 id=\"and-finally-some-massive-lists-of-free-learning-resources\">And Finally, Some Massive Lists of Free Learning Resources</h2><p>As promised, here are some massive lists of free courses for you. These are actively maintained. And they will keep you busy until the end of your days.</p><p>This first list includes 450 free online university courses from the 8 Ivy League universities – Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth College, and the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>You can do all of these courses from your laptop or phone, at your convenience.

    "html": "<p>For the past 3 years, freeCodeCamp has surveyed 10,000s of developers about how they're learning to code and pursuing their careers. And we've <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/fccuser/datasets\">made our full datasets publicly available</a>.</p><p>In 2020, we decided to take a year off. So this article isn't about a new dataset from us. Rather, it's about a survey conducted by our friends at HackerRank. They surveyed 116,000 developers for <a href=\"https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2020\">their 2020 skills report</a>. And I'm going to break down the results that I think are most relevant to new developers here.</p><p>Many of the developers they surveyed were also hiring managers. So let's start there.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-hiring-managers-look-for-in-developer-hires\">What do Hiring Managers Look for in Developer Hires?</h2><p>It turns out this depends a lot on the size of the company.</p><p>Smaller companies rely more heavily on generalists. They bring on lots of full-stack developers who can wear many hats.</p><p>This usually comes at the expense of dedicated front-end and back-end developers.</p><h3 id=\"smaller-companies-consider-full-stack-developers-more-important-larger-companies-are-more-likely-to-want-specialists-\">Smaller companies consider full-stack developers more important. Larger companies are more likely to want specialists.</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/HackerRank_s_2020_Developer_Skills_Report8.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A chart from HackerRank's 2020 Developer Skills report showing that for smaller companies (less than 50 employees) 43% consider Full-stack Developer to be their highest priority hiring role.</figcaption></figure><p>If you think about it for a moment, this makes sense. Larger companies allow for more specialization.</p><p>This said, most hiring managers at all sized companies reported prioritized front-end, back-end, or full-stack developers. Only about 30% of hiring managers considered it a higher priority to fill roles like:</p><ul><li>DevOps Engineering</li><li>Data Scientist</li><li>QA Engineer</li></ul><p>And in terms of skills that employers are looking for when they hire...</p><h3 id=\"javascript-is-still-the-most-sought-after-programming-language-skill-by-employers-\">JavaScript is still the most sought-after programming language skill by employers.</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/HackerRank_s_2020_Developer_Skills_Report7.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A chart showing language popularity among hiring managers by region, with JavaScript as the most popular language, followed Python and Java.</figcaption></figure><p>JavaScript was by far the most popular globally, followed by Python.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Java is still very much in demand. C# and C++ are more popular in the Africa-Europe-Middle-East region than elsewhere.</p><p>But one of the most interesting insights here is that a growing number of managers – especially in The Americas – are \"language agnostic.\" They don't really care which specific programming languages you know.</p><p>This goes back to something <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-19a33b0a467d/\">I've been preaching ad nauseam</a> over the past few years: <strong>if you can learn one programming language well, you can easily learn a second language on-the-job.</strong></p><p>So I'm glad more employers are acknowledging this reality instead of just posting jobs for \"JavaScript developers\" or \"Python developers.\"</p><p><strong>What</strong> a developer has built in the past is a much better indicator of ability than <strong>which</strong> specific tools they used to build it.</p><h3 id=\"fewer-and-fewer-employers-require-university-degrees-and-smaller-companies-are-more-flexible-on-this-\">Fewer and fewer employers require university degrees. And smaller companies are more flexible on this.</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/HackerRank_s_2020_Developer_Skills_Report9.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A chart showing the proportion of developers who have no Bachelor's degree, who have a degree, and who have graduate degrees - sorted by employer size. Smaller companies are more likely to hire developers who don't have degrees.</figcaption></figure><p>31% of developers who work at small companies don't have Bachelor's degrees (also known as \"undergraduate degrees\" or \"4 year degrees\" in the US).</p><p>And even at large companies, 9% to 18% of their developer workforce don't have degrees.</p><p>This represents a pretty big shift from the 1990's and early 2000's when most developer jobs required a degree.</p><p>If you think about this for a moment, though, it makes perfect sense.</p><p>The cost of earning a university degree – certainly in the US – has skyrocketed over the past 40 years.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_prestoncooper2_files_2017_05_baumol1-1200x846.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Inflation in US University tuition and fees VS overall inflation (Consumer Price Index). Source: The US National Center for Education Statistics.</figcaption></figure><p>More and more Americans are choosing to forego traditional university degrees in favor of self-learning.</p><p>My advice has always been: <strong>go to a cheap community college, then a cheap public university. </strong>I still think 4 year degrees are worth it if you can earn them without going into debt.</p><p>But I can understand why someone who's already past the traditional university age (late teens to early 20s) may want to skip university entirely.</p><p>This 2,500% increase in university tuition and fees has also coincided with the birth of the world wide web, and a wealth of free learning resources.</p><p>These days you can learn pretty much anything for free if you're willing to sit down and learn it.</p><p>So it's heartening to see more and more employers who are bringing on fully self-taught developers in addition to university graduates.</p><p>And there's a new middle ground between going to university and just learning everything for free on the web: coding bootcamps.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/coding-bootcamp-handbook/\">I've written extensively about coding bootcamps</a>, and the role they can play for people who don't want to go back to school.</p><p>Most people are able to successfully get a developer job after a year or two of self-teaching with online resources, attending local tech events, and hanging out at local hackerspaces.</p><p>But some people prefer the added structure and accountability that enrolling in a coding bootcamp can provide. These can be nearly as expensive as going to community college + state universities. But they are a bit faster.</p><p>And the good news is that some employers are hiring these coding bootcamp grads, and are sharing their opinions of them.</p><h2 id=\"do-coding-bootcamps-work-here-s-data-from-employers-\">Do Coding Bootcamps Work? Here's Data From Employers.</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/HackerRank_s_2020_Developer_Skills_Report11.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A chart showing that nearly 32% of hiring managers surveyed had hired a developer who went through a coding bootcamp.</figcaption></figure><p>About 32% of hiring managers surveyed said they'd hired a coding bootcamp grad.</p><p>And here's what they had to say about their perception of these bootcamp grads' skills:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/HackerRank_s_2020_Developer_Skills_Report10.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A chart showing most hiring managers consider coding bootcamp graduates to be as well-equipped for the job as non-bootcamp grads.</figcaption></figure><p>They found these coding bootcamp grads to mostly be as well equipped as their other hires. And nearly a 1/3 said coding bootcamp grads were better than their typical hire.</p><p>One thing to note is that many coding bootcamp grads already have Bachelor's degrees – some in Computer Science and Engineering fields. So some of these bootcamp grads have more education than a typical hire would have.</p><p>Also note that the quality of instruction among different coding bootcamps varies dramatically. </p><p>This survey didn't release the underlying data, so we don't know which coding bootcamps are most favorable among employers. We also don't know how many of these were traditional in-person coding bootcamps VS online coding bootcamps. (And if you've read my articles in the past, you'll know that I think much more highly of the in-person variety.)</p><p>But either way, the fact that the 32% of hiring managers who have hired a coding bootcamp grad think so highly of their skills has to be reassuring for all the developers out there who have founded their own coding bootcamps in their cities.</p><h2 id=\"what-skills-are-developers-interested-in-learning\">What Skills are Developers Interested in Learning?</h2><p>While JavaScript is the most widely used and most widely-sought programming language skill today, there's always a question of what's next.</p><p>Fortunately the survey covered that, too. Here's the chart:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/HackerRank_s_2020_Developer_Skills_Report6.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A chart showing that 36% of developers want to learn Go next, followed by Python and Kotlin.</figcaption></figure><p>We can assume that most of the respondents already know JavaScript since it's hard to be a developer in 2020 without knowing it.

    "slug": "web-developer-roadmap",
    "html": "<p>There are many ways you can go about picking up the skills you need to become a developer.</p><p>There are linear curriculums that teach you a bit of everything - like freeCodeCamp's full stack development curriculum.</p><p>And then there are massive lists of skills - and sometimes lists of resources - you can use to \"choose your own adventure\" through the learning process.</p><p>One of the best such list of skills is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse\">Kamran Ahmed's</a> Developer Roadmap, which he regularly updates.</p><p>This is no ordinary list of resources. Kamran has painstakingly mapped out all the skills he feels are essential to breaking into different fields of development.</p><p>I've written about his roadmap in the past. And to celebrate us all being half way into 2020, I'm going to share his entire roadmap here - all three of them.</p><p>That's right - he has lists of tools and resources that are required for the following paths:</p><ul><li>Front end web development</li><li>Back end web development</li><li>DevOps (also known as \"site reliability\" - this is sort of an evolution of the old System Administrator role)</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/08/intro.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"the-skills-all-developers-need-regardless-of-their-specialization\">The skills all developers need regardless of their specialization</h2><p>In addition to these paths, Kamran also recommends everyone who wants to work as a developer learn the following skills:</p><h3 id=\"git-version-control\">Git - Version Control</h3><p>Git is a powerful version control system that as of 2020 is used almost universally. If you don't know it - yes it's related to GitHub and GitLab, and you can learn how to use those tools, too.</p><h3 id=\"basic-terminal-usage-the-bash-command-line-ssh-and-other-skills\">Basic Terminal Usage - The Bash Command Line, SSH, and other skills</h3><p>This could be the terminal on a Mac, a Windows DOS prompt, or Bash/ZSH. Note that regardless of which operating system you use, you should probably learn Linux. Even if you're not using it for your laptop/desktop environment, you'll almost certainly use it for servers.</p><h3 id=\"data-structures-and-algorithms\">Data Structures and Algorithms</h3><p>The freeCodeCamp curriculum covers these in-depth. You'll probably want to learn these by solving lots of algorithm problems on freeCodeCamp, CodeWars, Project Euler, or another drilling website. I personally recommend doing this in either JavaScript or Python but if you're up for a challenge and have lots of time on your hands, doing it in C wouldn't hurt.</p><h3 id=\"an-understanding-of-how-the-web-works-https-and-apis\">An understanding of how the web works: HTTPS and APIs</h3><p>There are a lot of other concepts you can learn. I recommend working through a good entry-level computer science course to get started. Here's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmGw5fN5BQlwuug-8bDmabi\">all of Harvard's CS50 course lectures ad-free on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel</a>.</p><h2 id=\"design-patterns-yagni-kiss-solid\">Design Patterns, YAGNI, KISS, SOLID</h2><p>I don't think beginners need a deep understanding of these, but it wouldn't hurt.</p><p>Design Patterns are basically time-tested ways to implement different types of software systems and coding structures. You can learn these gradually as you progress.</p><p>As for the alphabet soup, here's what these stand for:</p><ul><li><strong>YAGNI - Ya Ain't Gonna Need It - </strong>The philosophy that most of the code you think you'll need to write and the features you'll need to implement will actually turn out to be unnecessary</li><li><strong>KISS - Keep it simple, silly! - </strong>The simpler you keep your projects the easier your life will be when it comes to maintenance.</li><li><strong>SOLID - This is a mnemonic for \"</strong>Single responsibility,‌‌Open–closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion\". Yeah - not beginner's stuff, but look into this if you're curious.</li></ul><h2 id=\"front-end-web-development-roadmap\">Front End Web Development Roadmap</h2><p>Kamran's first roadmap focuses on front end web development. </p><p>Here's his Front End Roadmap in its entirety:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/08/frontend.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"my-thoughts-on-the-front-end-roadmap\">My thoughts on the Front End Roadmap</h3><p>This is a solid list of fundamental skills. </p><p>As a front end developer, you will definitely be working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - lots and lots of JavaScript.</p><p>The only things I think are unnecessary here:</p><ul><li>CSS Preprocessors. These use to be necessary, but CSS itself has added many of the features that made these preprocessors so useful. <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn\">freeCodeCamp currently teaches Sass</a>, but we are in the process of phasing that out as well.</li><li>CSS Architecture: I don't think these are necessary unless you designing CSS systems is a big part of your day-to-day job.</li><li>A bit of a nitpick: TypeScript is a promising way to reduce bugs and code with confidence. We're adding this to <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/help-us-build-version-7-0-of-the-freecodecamp-curriculum/263546\">Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp core curriculum</a>. I think this should be even more prominent on the roadmap, but it is on there.</li><li>Web Assembly is a nice-to-have in my opinion. Developers are starting to do exciting things with it, but it will be a while before this technology really becomes ubiquitous.</li></ul><h2 id=\"back-end-web-development-roadmap\">Back End Web Development Roadmap</h2><p>Kamran's second roadmap focuses on back end web development. If you combine this with his front end map, you get a pretty good path to becoming a full stack developer.</p><p>Here's his entire Back End Roadmap:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/08/backend.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"my-thoughts-on-the-back-end-roadmap\">My thoughts on the Back End Roadmap</h3><p>I agree with everything here.</p><h3 id=\"yes-you-should-learn-sql-and-relational-databases\">Yes you should learn SQL and relational databases</h3><p>I want to strongly agree with his recommendation that you learn a relational database. </p><p>Yes - databases like MongoDB and Neo4j can do a lot for you, and are better suited to certain types of applications than relational databases.</p><p>But you should still learn SQL and understand how relational databases work.</p><p>I recommend PostgreSQL (which we use for several projects at freeCodeCamp), but other relational databases are pretty similar.</p><p>Here's freeCodeCamp's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY\">free 4-hour course on SQL</a>, which will teach you the basics.</p><p>And if you want to dive even deeper, here's our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc\">free 8-hour course on relational database design</a>.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-choose-the-right-back-end-development-programming-language\">How to choose the right back end development programming language</h3><p>I also want to add a note on choosing a language. </p><p>Even though there are many languages - and you can do essentially anything with any language - I strongly recommend learning either Node.js (JavaScript) or Python as your first language. </p><p>Here is a detailed guide to <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-choose-which-programming-language-you-should-learn-in-2019-60abef241012/\">which programming language should you learn first</a>.</p><h2 id=\"devops-roadmap\">DevOps Roadmap</h2><p>Finally, Kamran covers how to become a DevOps, or Site Reliability Engineer. This involves working with a lot of cloud services and overseeing infrastructure. </p><p>Here's his entire DevOps roadmap:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/08/devops.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"my-thoughts-on-the-devops-roadmap\">My thoughts on the DevOps roadmap</h3><p>Linux, Linux, Linux.</p><p>Also, I would recommend working as a developer first, then gradually coming to specialize in DevOps.</p><p>Here's a quick <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqMUoINlKnY\">30-minute introduction to the field of DevOps</a> that should give you a better idea of whether DevOps is something you're interested.</p><p>That's all. What do you think? Did Kamran leave out any essential skills or technologies? Leave a comment and let's hash this out.</p><p>Also, if you have any resources that have worked really well for you learning these skills, share them below as a comment.</p><p>Happy coding!</p><p>– Quincy</p>",

Then click \"Access Dashboard\" to configure it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/01/Dashboard_-_Quincy_Larson_s_Blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>There are a ton of ways you can customize your Hashnode blog. But today we're just going to focus on getting it live on your own domain.</p><p>Hashnode recommends using a subdomain for this so that you can get access to their global CDN and edge caching, so that's what we're going to do in this tutorial.</p><p>If you haven't already bought a domain, you can do so. I recommend choosing a domain name where you can buy the same name for .com, .org, and .net, since those are the \"big 3\" original top-level domains that have existed since the 1990s. (Before <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-top-level-domains-a-money-grab-and-a-mistake-paul-vixie/\">the great TLD cash-grab</a>.)</p><p>You only need to configure your Hashnode blog for one of your domains. You can then redirect your other domains over to it.</p><p>Here is how you should configure your DNS. Note that this is NameCheap's DNS dashboard, but most dashboards will look similar, and all will have a CNAME option:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/01/Advanced_DNS.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A picture of my personal domain name dashboard on Namecheap. The blog subdomain is pointed to my Hashnode blog and the www and root domains redirect to my personal Twitter account.</figcaption></figure><p>Create a CNAME record and set the host to whatever you want your subdomain to be (I chose <code>blog</code>). </p><p>Then set its value to <code>hashnode.network</code></p><p>Hashnode will handle issuing your SSL certificate for you, so you'll automatically get a nice <code>https</code> at the front of your blog's URL. ?</p><p>I set the TTL to 1 minute so it would refresh faster but you may not have to do this.</p><p>Presto. You can go to <code>https://[your subdomain].[your domain].[your TLD]</code> and see your Hashnode blog.</p><p>For example, my Hashnode blog is at <a href=\"https://blog.quincylarson.com\">https://blog.quincylarson.com</a>.</p><h2 id=\"you-re-done-\">You're done.</h2><p>I told you it was fast.</p><p>Now you can use Hashnode's markdown editor to create your first blog post.</p><p>Happy blogging.</p>",

And this year, I went a step further.</p><p>But first, let me tell you about #100DaysOfCode.</p><p>Alex Kallaway created the #100DaysOfCode challenge back in 2016. </p><p>I had the honor of hanging out with Alex in Toronto, and I even <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/\">wrote an in-depth history of the challenge</a>.</p><p>The #100DaysOfCode challenge is massive. How massive? To give you an idea: challenge participants tweet the #100DaysOfCode hashtag once ever 20 seconds.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode\">#100DaysOfCode Twitter bot</a> – which does nothing but randomly retweet people who tweet with hashtag – has more Twitter followers than a lot of Fortune 500 companies do.</p><p>The #100DaysOfCode challenge works like this:</p><ol><li>You code at least a little bit each day for 100 days in a row. Each day you tweet about what you did.</li><li>Each day you reply to other people's tweets to support them.</li></ol><p>That's it. Super simple. It's a public commitment device with a built-in support network to help keep you motivated.</p><p>This is a powerful model for any kind of endurance-based challenge.</p><p>This year I wanted to channel the brilliant simplicity of the #100DaysOfCode challenge into more advanced developer challenges.</p><p>These 2 new challenges are a good fit for more advanced developers who may not have the time to commit to the #100DaysOfCode challenge.</p><p>These challenges are also well-suited to people who have already finished one or two rotations of #100DaysOfCode, and want to try something more advanced.</p><p>And so the #ProjectEuler100 challenge and the #AWSCertified were born.</p><p>In this article, I'll explain these challenges briefly and also showcase some of their participants' achievements so far.</p><h2 id=\"an-update-on-the-projecteuler100-challenge\">An Update On The #ProjectEuler100 Challenge</h2><p>Project Euler is a website created back in 2001. It hosts a collection of around 600 different algorithm problems that get progressively harder, to the point where even people with math PhD's still struggle with them.</p><p>This said, the first 100 problems are totally do-able by a new developer. Thousands of people have completed the first 100 Project Euler problems over the years.</p><p>It's just brutally hard. Like... Dark Souls hard.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/01/Dark_Souls__Prepare_to_Die_Edition_Box_Shot_for_PC_-_GameFAQs.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Dark Souls is a video game famous for being ridiculously hard.

I love these so much that we've added these Project Euler problems to <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/\">freeCodeCamp's Interview Preparation section</a>.</p><p>I've boiled everything down to these 6 simple rules all participants must follow.</p><ol><li>Tweet out a photo of yourself giving a thumbs-up and announcing that you are committing to the #ProjectEuler100 challenge.</li><li>Create a GitHub repository.</li><li>Each time you complete a problem, add your solution to your GitHub repository and tweet a link to it using the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag.</li><li>Then scroll through the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag and give supportive feedback on at least 2 tweets from other developers.</li><li>Move on to the next Project Euler problem. You can't skip ahead. You have to complete all 100 problems in order. But you can use any programming language you want to solve these.</li><li>Once you've finished all 100 of them, tweet out a celebration photo of yourself with your laptop open to your GitHub repo.</li></ol><p>So far more than 700 people have joined the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/xpWc7Wk\">#ProjectEuler100 Discord chatroom</a>. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProjectEuler100\">#ProjectEuler100 Twitter bot</a> is already up to 300 followers.</p><p>And since this challenge is completely self-paced, several super-motivated developers are already reaching the last half of the challenge.</p><p>Here are some things people are tweeting about the challenge:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Used goroutines for solving problem 12 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/projecteuler?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#projecteuler</a> , was such a bliss !!! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProjectEuler100?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ProjectEuler100</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Golang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Golang</a> <br><br>On a pretty low spec machine <a href=\"https://t.co/rjp7Bv1ZzH\">pic.twitter.com/rjp7Bv1ZzH</a></p>&mdash; Anjan Roy (@meanjanry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meanjanry/status/1216303281221226496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I spent time refactoring my solution to problem 8 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProjectEuler100?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ProjectEuler100</a> but I still don&#39;t find it quite as readable as I&#39;d want it to be.
