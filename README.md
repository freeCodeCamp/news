# Developer News

Welcome to freeCodeCamp's [Developer News][1] codebase â€” A JAMStack app built with [Ghost][2] & [11ty][3] & lots of love from the community.

The code is based on this [template][4]. We use this project to build and deploy multiple instances of our publications in several world languages.

Content is fetched from Ghost, packaged into docker images, and deployed to Azure WebApp for Containers on Azure App Service.

All of the services are then distributed globally by our CDN provider.
