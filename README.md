# Developer News

Welcome to freeCodeCamp's [Developer News](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news)
codebase â€” A JAMStack app built with [Ghost](https://ghost.org) &
[11ty](https://www.11ty.io) & lots of love from the community.

The scaffolding is based on a
[template](https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost) developed by
[David Darnes](https://darn.es/), and is customized to the design language
recommended by freeCodeCamp. We use this project to build and deploy several
instances of the developer news applications powering all our global and
localized publication content.
