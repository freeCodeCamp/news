# Developer News

Welcome to freeCodeCamp's [Developer News][1] codebase â€” A JAMStack app built with [Ghost][2] & [11ty][3] & lots of love from the community.

The code is based on this [template][4]. We use this project to build and deploy multiple instances of our publications in several world languages. All of the services are then distributed globally by our CDN provider.

## Contributing

**Note:** We limit direct contributions (in the form of pull requests) to this project due to limitations with our QA & deployment workflows.

We welcome you to work on any of our other available open-source projects instead. You can find our contributing guidelines [here][5].

If you found an issue or a bug on this repository, please connect with us in the contributor's chat room first.

Happy Contributing!

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Where do I check the status of the latest build?

You can check the status of the latest builds by clicking the Deployment Status badge in the previous section.

#### I published an article. Why has it not appeared on news yet?

Your published article and changes may take longer than usual to appear. We also have multiple layers of caching. This helps us to serve the content faster to our users.

When you publish a change, like updating scripts, a new article, updating old articles, adding or updating pages, etc., in Ghost CMS, it will eventually appear on the public-facing site.

It can take up to 1 hour for the changes to appear on the site. If you are still not seeing the changes, please wait for a few hours.

#### I see a build has failed, what should I do?

We recommend giving changes at least a day before reaching out to someone to take a look. We have recovery workflows in place to fix most of the issues.

Also, the team gets alerts for all build failures, etc. You need not alert them again.
